## Jamil

The dream came at the new moon, when darkness was complete.

Jamil woke—or thought he woke—to find himself standing on the carpet in their cramped front room. Moonlight fell through the high window, though there should have been no moon. The carpet glowed beneath his bare feet, warm as living skin.

In the dream, the carpet was unrolling itself.

It stretched beyond the walls of their room, beyond the house, beyond Baghdad entirely. It unrolled across desert and mountain, across distances he couldn't name, until it reached water. Blue water, bluer than the Tigris, bluer than any water he'd ever imagined. The Mediterranean, some part of him knew, though he'd never seen the sea.

The carpet stopped at a city of white stone beside that impossible blue. Buildings rose in terraces. Ships crowded a harbor. People walked streets in a mixture of dress: turbans and hats, veils and bare heads, the cosmopolitan chaos of a port where worlds collided.

He walked the carpet's length in his dream, his feet moving without his will. When he reached the city, he saw a shop. Inside, a family—his family, though their faces were strange to him. A man and woman and children. They were hanging carpets for sale, laughing about something, alive with purpose.

And then he saw her: a girl, perhaps ten years old, with eyes that were Jalila's eyes. His sister's eyes in a stranger's face. She stood before a carpet—the carpet, aged and faded but unmistakably theirs—and touched it with reverence.

"Grandfather," she said to the man. "Tell me the story again. About Isfahan and the fire."

The man smiled. "Which fire? The one in the temple, or the one that never goes out?"

"Both," the girl said.

In the dream, Jamil tried to speak to them, to say *I'm your grandfather's grandfather, I'm here, I see you*, but no sound came. He was witness only, not participant. He watched the family in the shop until the dream faded and—

—and he woke in his bed, gasping, dawn light filtering through the same window that had shown moonlight moments before.

Across the room, Jalila sat up at the same moment.

They looked at each other, and Jamil knew: she'd had the same dream.

## Jalila

She'd been dreaming of the sea for months, but this was different. This was *seeing*.

Jalila rose from her mat and went to where the carpet lay rolled in the corner, tucked behind the flour sacks and water jars that were all they owned. Their father had been a failure as a merchant. Their mother had died bringing them into the world. They'd grown up poor in a family that remembered being prosperous, told stories of Isfahan goldsmith ancestors while eating bread and onions.

The carpet was all they had left of that grand past. And Jalila had always been able to see things in it that others couldn't.

She unrolled it now in the pre-dawn darkness. Six cubits by nine, though sections were worn, colors faded. It had been old when their great-great-grandmother was young. It should have disintegrated by now, but something in it refused to die.

Jamil joined her, kneeling at the carpet's edge.

"You saw it too," he said. Not a question.

"The city by the sea. The shop. The girl with my eyes."

"Our descendants."

"Or a possible future." Jalila ran her hands over the carpet's patterns. In the growing light, she could see how they'd changed. When had that happened? Sometime in the night, new images had appeared—or perhaps old images had surfaced, like bodies rising from a river.

She saw: a journey. Mountains and desert. A family carrying this carpet westward. Suffering, yes, but also arrival. A new life in a new place.

"Beirut," she said. The name came to her lips unbidden. "The city is called Beirut."

"How do you know?"

"The carpet told me."

Jamil made a sound that might have been skepticism or might have been fear. Her brother—her twin, her other half—had always resisted the magic. He wanted the world to make rational sense. But he couldn't deny what he'd dreamed, because he'd been inside her head when she dreamed it. They'd shared minds since before birth.

"If the carpet is telling us to go to Beirut," Jamil said carefully, "does that mean we should? Or is it just showing us one possible path?"

"Does it matter? Look at us, Jamil. We're twenty-five and dying slowly in this place. Father drinks himself stupid. We take in laundry to afford bread. In another year, we'll be past marrying age, and then what? We grow old in this room and die without children, and the family ends with us."

"So we should abandon everything on the strength of a dream?"

"Not a dream. A vision. And not just mine—yours too. When have we ever dreamed the same thing except when it was true?"

He had no answer for that. Since childhood, they'd shared dreams, shared thoughts, shared the strange in-between space that twins sometimes inhabited. When Jamil had broken his arm as a boy, Jalila had felt the pain in her matching arm. When Jalila had fallen ill with fever, Jamil had burned with sympathetic heat.

They were two halves of one person. And when both halves saw the same future, that future had weight.

"Not yet," Jamil said finally. "We're not ready. We have no money, no plan. If we go now, we'll die on the road."

"Then we prepare. We save. And when the time is right—"

"If the time is ever right."

But Jalila saw the capitulation in his eyes. Her practical brother, her skeptic twin, had seen what she'd seen. The carpet had spoken to both of them. They would go. The only question was when.

## Jalila

The visions intensified after that night.

Jalila would wake from sleep to find she'd walked in her dreams. Not just mental wandering but physical movement. She'd wake on the roof of their building, or by the Tigris a mile away, or once—impossibly—inside a mosque she'd never entered, prostrate before the mihrab as if in prayer.

She always knew when it was coming. A feeling like gravity reversing, like the earth losing its hold on her. She'd go to sleep and wake elsewhere, with desert dust in her mouth or river water on her feet or temple incense clinging to her clothes.

"You're walking between times," her grandmother said when Jalila confessed. The old woman was ninety, half-blind, but she remembered the old stories. "It runs in the family. Your great-great-however-many-greats-grandmother did it. Shirin. The first weaver. She could walk in time like you walk in space."

"How do I control it?"

"You don't. It controls you. But you can learn to see what it's showing you. The sleepwalking has a purpose."

So Jalila stopped fighting it. She let herself be taken. And the places she went began to make a pattern.

She walked in Isfahan, two centuries gone. Saw the fire temple, saw Shirin weaving. She walked in a future Baghdad where Ottoman flags flew and children spoke Turkish. She walked in Beirut—not the Beirut of her vision but an earlier one, medieval, Crusader-built, its fortifications crumbling.

And always, in these walks, she saw the carpet. Sometimes being woven, sometimes being carried, sometimes hanging on a wall or rolled in a chest. The carpet was the thread connecting all times, all places. It was less an object than a road, and Jalila was learning to walk it.

One night, she walked straight into the past.

She woke—walked?—to find herself in a courtyard she recognized from dreams. Isfahan, the Maktabian house, two hundred years ago. The pomegranate tree young and thriving. Two women sitting by a loom. One weaving, one watching.

Shirin and Esther, grandmother and granddaughter-in-law, separated by death but united in this moment that existed outside time.

Shirin looked up and saw Jalila. "Ah," she said, as if Jalila's appearance was expected. "You're the one who will make the choice."

"What choice?" Jalila's voice worked in this place-between-times.

"To remember or forget. To go or stay. To trust the carpet or trust the rational world." Shirin's hands never stopped weaving, shuttle flying. "Your brother will doubt. You will know. Together, you'll do what must be done."

"How do you know this?"

"I wove it. All of it. Your brother's skepticism, your certainty, the journey you'll take. I saw you in my visions before you were born. You're in the carpet already. You're just walking toward the place where the pattern shows you."

Jalila looked at what Shirin was weaving. She saw herself in the threads, and Jamil beside her. She saw them walking westward, the carpet rolled on Jamil's back. She saw suffering and arrival.

"Will we survive?" she asked.

Shirin smiled. "The carpet survives. That's all I can promise. The people in it—some survive, some don't. But the pattern continues."

"That's not reassuring."

"Truth rarely is."

Jalila woke in her bed, heart pounding. Across the room, Jamil stirred.

"You walked again," he said. "I felt you leave."

"I know. I'm sorry."

"Don't be. I'm starting to understand. We're connected to this thing—" he gestured at the rolled carpet "—in ways I can't explain rationally. And maybe that's fine. Maybe some things don't need explanation."

From her skeptical twin, this was revolution.

## Jamil

Jamil spent the next year saving money. He worked as a carpet repairer, his hands learning the craft his ancestors had perfected. Every knotted thread taught him something about patience, about pattern, about the way small choices accumulated into lasting design.

At night, he and Jalila would unroll the carpet and study it by lamplight. She saw visions; he saw technique. She saw prophecy; he saw craftsmanship. But slowly, they began to see the same things.

"Here," Jalila would say, pointing to a section. "This shows the journey. See how the pattern moves from right to left? East to west. And these colors—they shift from earth tones to water tones. Desert to sea."

Jamil would look and see what she meant. The carpet was a map, yes, but also an instruction. It showed not just where to go but how to prepare, what to expect, what to carry forward.

"We'll need at least twenty dinars," he calculated. "For the journey, for starting over. If I work hard, save everything—maybe two years."

"We don't have two years," Jalila said. "I saw it last night. We need to leave within eighteen months. After that, the window closes."

"What window?"

"I don't know. But there's a moment when the path is clear. If we miss it—" She shrugged. "We might make it anyway. Or we might not. The future isn't fixed. But there are optimal moments. I saw one. Autumn next year."

Jamil wanted to argue, to demand rational explanation. But he'd learned to trust his sister's visions, even when they contradicted his plans.

"Eighteen months," he agreed. "We'll be ready."

## Jalila

The year passed in preparation and visions. Jalila felt herself changing, becoming less solid, more permeable. She existed increasingly between worlds—the physical Baghdad she walked during the day, and the temporal elsewhere she visited at night.

She met Shirin twice more in those time-walks. The ancient weaver taught her things: how to read the carpet's deeper patterns, how to open her mind to prophetic sight, how to ground herself when the visions threatened to sweep her away entirely.

"You have the gift stronger than anyone since me," Shirin said during their third meeting. "But gifts are dangerous. They can consume you."

"How did you survive it?"

"I wove. The weaving grounded me. Turned vision into creation. You'll need your own grounding. Your twin. He keeps you real."

It was true. Jamil was her anchor. When the visions threatened to pull her into their current, she'd find Jamil and touch his hand, and his solidity would remind her: she was human, she was mortal, she was here.

"I don't know if I'll survive the journey," she told him one night. They sat by the Tigris, watching the water flow eternally toward the distant sea. "I saw something. Me, falling. Fever, I think. I don't know if I make it to Beirut."

Jamil went very still. "Then we don't go."

"No. We go anyway. Because it's not about me surviving. It's about the carpet surviving. About the family continuing. And I saw—even if I die, you make it. Your son makes it. The carpet reaches Beirut."

"I don't have a son."

"You will. You'll marry, and you'll have a son, and you'll name him Farid. I saw him clearly. He has your face and your hands. And he carries the carpet forward."

They sat in silence, watching the river.

"I don't want to do this without you," Jamil finally said.

"I know. But you will if you have to. That's what we do. That's what being Maktabian means."

## Jamil

Autumn came. They had seventeen dinars, which would have to be enough. Their father had died over the summer—liver failure, surprise to no one—leaving them truly untethered. No family except each other, no ties except the carpet.

The night before they were to leave, Jalila and Jamil performed a private ceremony. They unrolled the carpet in their empty room, lit candles, spoke the names of their ancestors back as far as they could remember. Shirin and Maktab. Yousef and Esther. Ibrahim and David. Hassan and Leah. Names like a prayer, a genealogy of survival.

"We carry you forward," Jalila said to the carpet. "We become the thread that stretches from past to future. Guide us. Keep us. Remember us when we forget ourselves."

That night, they both dreamed the same dream: the white city by the blue sea, welcoming them home.

In the morning, they rolled the carpet tight, tied it with rope, and slung it on Jamil's back. It was heavier than six cubits of wool should be, but he'd learned to carry that weight. They locked the door to the room where they'd been born, and left the key with their neighbor.

"If we don't come back—" Jamil started to say.

"We'll come back," Jalila interrupted. "Maybe not us. But the family will. Someday, someone with our blood will walk these streets again and remember where we came from."

They walked to the city gate as the sun rose. Baghdad behind them, five hundred years of family history in that city, but it was done now. The carpet had shown them forward, and forward they would go.

"Ready?" Jamil asked.

Jalila smiled. "I've been ready since before I was born."

They stepped through the gate and headed west, following a path woven into wool two centuries before they were conceived, trusting that transformation was not death but change, that the carpet would carry them even if the road did not.

The twins walked toward the sea, and the carpet on Jamil's back glowed briefly in the morning light, as if recognizing the beginning of a journey it had always known would come.
