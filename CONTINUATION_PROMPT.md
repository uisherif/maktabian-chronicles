**Continue writing The Maktabian Chronicles novel.**

I have completed the foundation documents and 5 critical chapters. All project files are in `/Users/sherif.maktabi/Documents/Projects/book-test/`.

**Your task**: Continue writing the remaining chapters following the detailed scene breakdowns in `SCENE_BREAKDOWNS_chapters_4-22.md`.

**Priority order**:
1. Start with **Chapter 4: The Golden Light** (the next sequential chapter after Chapter 3)
2. Then proceed through chapters sequentially, OR
3. If you prefer, jump to the most emotionally critical remaining chapters: 13, 17, 21, and 22

**Requirements**:
- Each chapter should be 3,000-5,000 words
- Follow the magical realism style established in Chapters 1-3
- Reference the character profiles in `04_CHARACTERS.md` for consistency
- Use the scene breakdowns as your detailed guide
- Maintain the lyrical, sensory-rich prose style
- Save each chapter as `chapters/chapter_XX_[title].md`

**Key Style Reminders**:
- Opening lines should be striking and set immediate tone
- Use all five senses in every scene
- Magical elements presented matter-of-factly, never explained
- Dialogue is sparse but meaningful
- Show emotional moments through physical sensations
- Time can be fluid, non-linear when appropriate
- Each chapter should have clear emotional arc

**Critical Thematic Threads** (from `01_THEME.md`):
- Home is not a place but a continuity
- Faith is fluid, family is constant
- Memory as survival mechanism
- Transformation without losing essence
- The eternal recurrence of family patterns

**Magical Elements to Track** (from `02_SETTING_HISTORY.md`):
- The family carpet (prophetic, pattern-shifting)
- Pomegranate tree (appears at thresholds)
- Memory vessels (objects holding ancestral knowledge)
- Shared dreaming (especially among twins/close family)
- Mirror language (speaking to see truth)
- Rain of birds (appears at turning points)

**Character Genealogy Quick Reference**:
- Gen 1 (1450s Isfahan): Maktab & Shirin [Zoroastrian → Jewish]
- Gen 2 (1500s Isfahan): Ibrahim & Esther [Jewish → Muslim split]
- Gen 3 (1600s Isfahan): Hassan & Parvaneh [Muslim]
- Gen 4 (1700s Baghdad): Jamil & Jalila [twins who migrate]
- Gen 5 (1800s Beirut): Khalil & Sahar [establish in Lebanon]
- Gen 6 (1900s-1920s Beirut): Reza & Layla [modern era]

Continue without asking for approval. Work through the chapters systematically. When you complete each chapter, mark it done and move to the next. Let me know when you've completed all 17 remaining chapters, or when you approach the token limit.

Do not create any new documentation or README files unless explicitly requested. Focus entirely on writing the chapter content.

## Additional Context for Quality Control

**Completed Chapter Quality Benchmarks**:
- Chapter 1: Established prophetic weaving, fire temple rituals, Shirin's gift
- Chapter 2: Adult circumcision scene, Maktab's internal struggle with conversion
- Chapter 3: Three-year weaving structure, pomegranate tree appearance, dual POV
- Chapter 5: Family split, Esther's wisdom, generational pain
- Chapter 9: Twin telepathy, prophetic shared dreams, Jalila's time-walking

**What Makes These Chapters Work**:
1. Sensory immersion (smell of dye, taste of pomegranate, texture of wool)
2. Interiority (characters' thoughts feel intimate and authentic)
3. Pacing variation (contemplative moments + dramatic turning points)
4. Dialogue restraint (characters speak only when words matter)
5. Magical matter-of-factness (carpet glows, tree appears, no one questions)
6. Historical grounding (real dates, real political pressures)
7. Emotional specificity (not "sad" but "throat tight with unshed decades")

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- Over-explaining magical elements
- Modern psychological language in historical setting
- Rushing through sensory details
- Too much dialogue (this is a contemplative novel)
- Losing track of POV character's voice
- Forgetting to include magical element in each chapter
- Generic emotions instead of physical/metaphorical descriptions
