## Phase 2: Writing Process

### Step-by-Step Chapter Writing Protocol

**Before Writing Each Chapter:**

1. **Read these files**:
   - `03_PLOT.md` (overall plot)
   - `05_OUTLINE.md` (chapter outline)
   - Previous chapter file (if exists)
   - `04_CHARACTERS.md` (character reference)

2. **Create chapter file**: `chapters/chapter_XX_[title].md`

3. **Write chapter header**:
   ```markdown
   # Chapter XX: [Poetic Title]

   **Time Period**: [Year/Era]
   **Location**: [City, specific place]
   **POV Character**: [Name]
   **Key Events**: [Brief bullet points]
   **Magical Elements**: [What magical realism appears]
   ```

4. **Write the chapter**:
   - Start with a strong sensory image
   - Ground in historical detail but don't lecture
   - Let magical elements emerge naturally
   - Focus on intimate character moments
   - Build to an emotional or revelatory moment
   - End with resonance (image, question, or echo)

5. **Chapter checklist**:
   - [ ] Does it advance the family saga?
   - [ ] Does it feel rooted in its historical moment?
   - [ ] Is there at least one magical element?
   - [ ] Do characters feel alive and contradictory?
   - [ ] Is the prose lyrical but not purple?
   - [ ] Does it connect to other chapters thematically?

**Transitioning to Next Chapter:**

1. Read the completed chapter
2. Note any new threads that emerged
3. Update `03_PLOT.md` if story evolved
4. Review `05_OUTLINE.md` for next chapter
5. Consider: What echoes forward? What questions linger?

## Phase 3: Deep Editorial Review

**File**: `EDITORIAL_REVIEW.md`

After completing all chapters, conduct a comprehensive review focusing on:

### 3.1 Structural Edit
- **Arc completeness**: Does each generation's story satisfy?
- **Pacing**: Are there sections that drag or rush?
- **Balance**: Historical vs. intimate moments
- **Timeline**: Is the chronology clear even when non-linear?

### 3.2 Character Edit
- **Consistency**: Do characters stay true across their arcs?
- **Depth**: Are motivations complex and human?
- **Relationships**: Do family dynamics feel authentic?
- **Growth**: Do characters transform believably?

### 3.3 Prose Edit (Award-Winning Level)
Focus on achieving:
- **Rhythm**: Varied sentence length, musical prose
- **Imagery**: Every sense engaged, metaphors from the world of the story
- **Voice**: Distinct narrative voice that feels timeless yet immediate
- **Restraint**: Cutting anything that doesn't serve the story
- **Resonance**: Repeated images/phrases that gain meaning

**Specific techniques**:
- Replace weak verbs with strong, specific ones
- Cut adverbs, let verbs do the work
- Vary paragraph length for rhythm
- Use repetition purposefully (like García Márquez)
- Create leitmotifs: recurring symbols that deepen
- Ensure every chapter has at least one stunning sentence

### 3.4 Magical Realism Edit
- **Consistency of magic**: Do the rules stay consistent?
- **Integration**: Does magic feel inevitable, not arbitrary?
- **Metaphor**: Does each magical element illuminate theme?
- **Restraint**: Is there enough reality to ground the magic?

### 3.5 Historical Accuracy Edit
- Verify dates, events, cultural details
- Ensure anachronisms serve the story (if present)
- Check that power dynamics reflect historical reality
- Validate language, customs, material culture

### 3.6 Line Edit
- Grammar, syntax, punctuation
- Consistency in spelling (especially Arabic/Persian names)
- Remove redundancies
- Polish dialogue

### 3.7 Final Read
- Read aloud (or have it read to you)
- Does it have the emotional weight of great literature?
- Would this stand beside García Márquez, Pamuk, Mafouz?
