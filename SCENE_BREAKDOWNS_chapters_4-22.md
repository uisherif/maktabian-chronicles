## Writing Guidelines for Expansion

When expanding these scenes to full chapters:

**Pacing**:
- Each scene should have: arrival, development, climax, transition
- Vary rhythm: fast action, slow reflection, medium dialogue
- End scenes on image or emotion, not explanation

**Sensory Details**:
- Every scene needs: sight, sound, smell (minimum)
- Include: taste, touch when relevant
- Make Middle East sensory: spices, heat, dust, water, textiles

**Magical Realism Rules**:
- Present magic matter-of-factly, no explanation
- Ground magic in sensory detail (glowing threads, warm wool, impossible fruit)
- Characters react naturally, not with shock
- Magic serves theme, never just spectacle

**Dialogue**:
- Characters speak in their own voices (Nabil formal, Khalil poetic, Rania simple-profound)
- Use dialogue to reveal, not explain
- Include silences, pauses, subtext
- Mix languages occasionally (translated in context)

**Character Consistency**:
- Check character file before writing each chapter
- Maintain: voice, mannerisms, relationships, arc
- Show growth subtly through changing reactions

**Theme Integration**:
- Each scene should touch: transformation, survival, memory, or identity
- Don't state themes—show them through action and image
- Carpet always present (physically or mentioned)

**Transitions**:
- Between scenes: time jumps clear but graceful
- Between chapters: echo or contrast with previous ending
- Use weather, light, seasons to mark passage
