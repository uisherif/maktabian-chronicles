## The Desert

The desert was made of sand and sun and silence, and Sahar thought if she had to walk through one more day of it, she would turn into sand herself and blow away on the wind.

They'd been walking for six weeks. Six weeks since Baghdad disappeared behind them, six weeks since everything she'd known became memory. Now there was only walking: one foot forward, then the other, repeat until the sun set and they could finally stop.

Sahar was nine years old, and her feet hurt all the time.

"How much farther?" she asked her mother for the hundredth time.

Rania shifted Khalil on her hip—her little brother was too weak to walk much—and said what she always said: "Far. But not as far as yesterday."

That was the game they played. Every day was less far than before, even when it felt like the same endless distance. Sahar had learned not to ask more specific questions because the adults didn't have better answers. They knew the direction (west), they knew the destination (a city called Beirut, which Sahar couldn't picture), but the distance between here and there kept changing depending on who you asked.

The caravan they'd joined had seventeen people, eleven camels, and three donkeys. The leader was Mahmoud, a cloth merchant with a scar across his forehead and a voice like grinding stones. He'd agreed to let the Maktabian family travel with his group for protection—bandits rarely attacked large caravans—in exchange for what little money Father had saved.

Most of the other travelers ignored them. The Maktabians were obviously poor, obviously desperate, and desperation was common enough not to be interesting. But sometimes Sahar caught people staring at Great-Uncle Jamil and Great-Aunt Jalila, the ancient twins who walked with surprising steadiness despite being older than anyone had a right to be.

"Those two should have died years ago," she'd heard one of the camel drivers say. "It's not natural, people that old making this journey."

"Maybe they're blessed," another replied.

"Or cursed."

Sahar didn't think her great-aunt and great-uncle were cursed. She thought they were magic. She'd seen Aunt Jalila touch the carpet and go somewhere else without moving. She'd heard the stories about prophetic dreams and sleepwalking to Isfahan and conversations with ancestors who'd been dead for centuries.

And she'd seen the carpet herself. Really seen it, the way Aunt Jalila said only some people could. When she looked at its patterns, sometimes they moved. Sometimes faces appeared—people she didn't recognize but who felt like family. Sometimes the carpet whispered things in a language that wasn't words but that she understood anyway.

*Keep walking. You're almost there. Don't give up.*

The carpet was alive. Sahar knew this the way she knew her own name. And it wanted them to reach Beirut. Wanted it badly enough that it kept them going when they should have collapsed.

On the forty-fifth day of walking, Khalil stopped being able to eat.

---

It started as fever—nothing unusual; everyone in the caravan had been sick at some point—but this time the fever wouldn't break. Khalil burned and burned, his small body radiating heat that should have been impossible. He coughed until blood flecked his lips. His eyes glazed over, seeing things that weren't there.

"He's dying," Father said quietly to Mother, thinking Sahar and Nabil weren't listening. But Sahar always listened. She'd learned that adults said the truest things when they thought children couldn't hear.

"We have to stop," Mother said. "Let him rest, recover—"

"The caravan won't stop. Mahmoud made that clear. If we can't keep pace, we're left behind."

"Then we're left behind."

"Rania. In the desert, alone, with no water, no protection—we'd all die. Not just Khalil. All of us."

"So we let our son die so we don't slow down?"

"We do everything we can while moving. It's the only option."

That night, the caravan made camp near a dried riverbed. Khalil lay on a blanket, shivering despite the heat, while Mother pressed cool cloths to his forehead and whispered prayers in a mix of Arabic and something older, words Sahar didn't recognize.

Aunt Jalila knelt beside them, her ancient face creased with sorrow.

"I saw this," she said. "In my visions. He dies here, or he lives. Both possibilities exist right now, overlapping. Which one becomes real depends on the next few hours."

"What do I do?" Mother's voice cracked. "Tell me what to do."

"Wait here."

Aunt Jalila stood with difficulty and walked to where the carpet lay rolled in oilcloth, protected from sand and sun. She unwrapped it carefully, unrolled just one corner, and reached into a fold Sahar had never noticed before. From it, she withdrew a small cloth bag.

"Pomegranate seeds," Jalila said, returning to Khalil. "From the tree in Baghdad. The tree that appeared in our grandmother's courtyard. I saved them, knowing they'd be needed."

"Seeds will cure fever?"

"These seeds will. They carry memory, magic, protection. They're the family's medicine when nothing else works." Jalila opened the bag, revealing perhaps twenty dried seeds, each one dark as old blood. "Make him eat three. No more—they're too powerful for a child. Three seeds, and I'll sing the old songs. Between the magic and the music, we'll pull him back."

Mother took the seeds with shaking hands. She managed to get Khalil to swallow them—one, two, three—though he barely seemed conscious enough to register what was happening.

And then Aunt Jalila began to sing.

Sahar had never heard anything like it. The melody was old—ancient—in a language that predated Arabic, maybe predated all current languages. Persian, but older than Persian. The words sounded like fire, like prayer, like the chants their Zoroastrian ancestors had sung in temples four centuries ago.

As Jalila sang, the seeds began to glow. Sahar could see it: a faint red light in Khalil's throat, spreading through his small body, filling his veins with something that wasn't quite light and wasn't quite life but was both.

The other travelers noticed. They gathered at a distance, watching, whispering.

"Witchcraft," someone muttered.

"Or miracle," someone else replied.

Mahmoud the merchant stepped forward, his scarred face unreadable. "What is she doing?"

"Saving her great-nephew," Father said, his voice daring challenge.

"With magic?"

"Does it matter what it's called if it works?"

Mahmoud watched for a long moment, then: "As long as it doesn't curse the rest of us." He walked away, and the crowd dispersed, though Sahar felt their unease lingering like smoke.

Aunt Jalila sang for an hour, her voice never wavering despite her age. And slowly—so slowly Sahar almost didn't notice—Khalil's breathing eased. The fever broke. Color returned to his face. His eyes opened, focused, saw Mother and smiled.

"I saw them," he whispered. "The grandmothers. All of them. They said it's not my time yet. They said I have to write things down first. Poems. Important poems."

"Hush," Mother said, crying with relief. "You can write whatever you want. Just live."

"I will. The seeds told me. I'll live until my work is done. Then I'll join them. But not yet."

Aunt Jalila stopped singing. She looked exhausted, older even than her seventy-eight years. Uncle Jamil helped her sit, brought her water, held her while she recovered from whatever she'd done.

"Thank you," Mother said. "You saved him."

"The seeds saved him. And his own stubbornness. He's Maktabian—we don't die easily, even the fragile ones."

Later, when everyone else was asleep, Sahar crept to where Aunt Jalila sat, looking at the stars.

"Can I ask you something?"

"Always, child."

"The seeds. Why did they glow?"

"Because they remember what they came from. The pomegranate tree that appeared to your great-great-grandmother Leah. That tree was magic—real magic, not tricks or stories. And its fruit carries that magic forward. When eaten with intention and need, the seeds give what's required: healing, memory, vision, strength. Whatever the family needs to survive."

"Will I eat them someday?"

"Maybe. If you need to. Or maybe you'll give them to your children. The bag has fourteen seeds left. Enough for emergencies, but not infinite. We have to choose carefully when to use them."

"How do you know all this? The songs, the seeds, the carpet?"

Aunt Jalila smiled. "I've been learning my whole life. Walking between times, talking to ancestors, reading the carpet like it's a library. And soon I'll join those ancestors, and then I'll teach from the other side."

"You're going to die."

"Yes. Not tonight, but soon. In the mountains, I think. Or maybe the Syrian desert. It shifts—death is flexible about location, apparently. But soon."

"I'll miss you."

"You won't. Because I'll still be here, just invisible. You'll feel me when you need me. I'll be the voice that tells you which way to go when you're lost. I promise."

Sahar leaned against her great-aunt's shoulder, and they watched the stars together until sleep came.

## The Mountains

The desert gave way to foothills, then mountains. The air grew cooler, the landscape more varied. Instead of endless sand, there were rocks, scrubby plants, occasional streams. The walking was harder—uphill, downhill, unstable footing—but at least there was shade, and water that didn't taste like leather.

Khalil recovered slowly. He walked more now, though Mother still carried him when he tired. The seeds had saved him, but they'd changed him too. He spoke differently now, in odd phrases that sounded like poetry. He saw things others didn't—ghosts, probably, or visions, the way Aunt Jalila did.

"He's becoming like her," Nabil observed one evening. He was thirteen now, grown suddenly tall and serious during the journey. "Magic."

"Is that bad?" Sahar asked.

"I don't know. It's strange."

"We're all strange. We're Maktabians."

Nabil laughed despite himself. "Fair point."

In the mountains, the caravan encountered other travelers: traders moving east, pilgrims heading to Jerusalem, refugees like themselves fleeing something toward something else. News traveled with these groups, and Sahar listened to the adults exchange information.

The Ottoman Empire was crumbling. Wars everywhere. The sultan in Constantinople was desperate. Regional governors were consolidating power, ignoring orders from the capital. The old world was dying, something new being born in its place, and no one knew what shape it would take.

"Bad time to be traveling," Mahmoud said. "But then, when is it ever a good time?"

They climbed higher. The air grew thin, and at night, frost formed on their blankets. Aunt Jalila's cough worsened. Uncle Jamil watched his twin sister with increasing worry, knowing what was coming but unable to stop it.

One evening, as they camped in a mountain pass, Aunt Jalila unrolled the carpet and called the family together.

"I need to tell you things," she said. "While I still can."

They gathered around her: Uncle Jamil, Father, Mother, Nabil, Sahar, little Khalil. Seven people, three generations, all that remained of a family that had once been prosperous in Isfahan.

"We're close," Jalila said. "Two more weeks to the coast. Maybe three. I'll see the Mediterranean—I saw that in my visions—but I won't reach Beirut. That's all right. My work is getting you to the threshold, not crossing it myself."

"Don't," Uncle Jamil said. "Don't talk like that. You might survive. The seeds—"

"Won't work on me. I already know. I've seen my death too many times to mistake it. But listen—all of you—this is important."

She touched the carpet, tracing patterns. "When you reach Beirut, you'll be desperate. Refugees with nothing. But help will come. A man named Yousef—or maybe he'll use a different name; ghosts aren't consistent. He'll offer you a shop, money to start. Take it. He's your ancestor, paying a debt. Don't question it. Just accept and build."

She looked at Sahar. "You, child. You have the gift. Stronger than anyone since Shirin. The carpet chose you before you were born. When you're older, you'll learn to read it fully. To walk in its patterns like I walk through time. And you'll pass that knowledge to your daughter, who'll pass it to hers. You're the next keeper."

"I don't know how—"

"You'll learn. The carpet will teach you. So will I, from wherever I end up. And your mother—Rania, you see ghosts. That's preparation. You'll see me after I die, and I'll help you help Sahar. The family doesn't lose its magic when I go. It just shifts to the next generation."

She looked at Khalil. "You're going to be a poet. A brilliant one. You'll die young—I'm sorry, child, but you will. War or disease, I can't see clearly. But your poems will survive. They'll carry the family's story in verse. That's your work: translate what the carpet shows into words others can understand."

And to Nabil: "You're the practical one. Like your great-grandfather Jamil, like so many before you. You'll build the business, earn money, make the family stable. Without you, the magic wouldn't matter—you can't eat prophecy. You're the foundation. Don't think that's less important than visions."

She turned last to Father and Uncle Jamil. "You two will see the family established in Beirut. That's your task. Farid, you'll run the shop until you're old. Jamil, you'll die within a year of arrival—your work is done once we reach the coast. Neither of you has magic, but you don't need it. You have stubbornness, which is better."

Silence after she finished. Then Uncle Jamil spoke, his voice rough: "You sound like you're saying goodbye."

"Not yet. But soon. And I want you prepared. Want you to know your roles. Want you to understand that when I'm gone, the family continues. I'm not the thread—I'm just one knot in it. The thread is all of us, all of us who've ever been Maktabian, woven together across centuries. I'm adding my knot, and then the weaving continues."

That night, Sahar dreamed of the carpet. In the dream, she walked through its patterns as if they were streets in a city. She saw faces: Shirin weaving at her loom, Yousef working gold, Hassan drunk in a tavern, Leah eating pomegranate seeds. She saw Aunt Jalila young and old simultaneously, walking beside her.

"I'm showing you the path," dream-Jalila said. "Teaching you to read the map. You'll need this skill in Beirut. When the French come, when the war comes, when everything breaks—you'll need to read the carpet to know what to do."

"I'm scared."

"Good. Fear means you understand the stakes. But don't let it paralyze you. Walk through it, the way we're walking through the desert. One step at a time."

Sahar woke with her hand on the carpet, which Father had unrolled nearby. The patterns seemed brighter than usual, and she could almost see the path they'd taken from Baghdad, the path ahead to Beirut, all of it mapped in thread and color.

She was starting to read it. To understand.

The gift was waking up.

## The Sea

Seventeen days after the mountain camp, on a morning that felt like any other morning, Sahar smelled something different.

Salt. And something else—wetness, but not river-wetness. Something vast.

"What is that?" she asked.

Mother smiled. "The sea. We're close."

They climbed one more hill, this last hill, and then—

Blue. So much blue it hurt to look at. Blue that stretched to the horizon and beyond, meeting the sky, making it impossible to tell where water ended and air began. Blue that moved, that breathed, that was so completely unlike anything Sahar had ever seen that for a moment she forgot how to breathe herself.

"The Mediterranean," Father said, and his voice broke with relief and disbelief and something like joy. "We made it. We actually made it."

The whole family stood at the hilltop, staring. Four months of walking, of desert and mountains and thirst and fear, and here it was: the sea. Proof that the carpet had been right, that Aunt Jalila's visions were true, that stubborn faith could carry you across impossible distances.

Aunt Jalila was crying. So was Uncle Jamil. So was Mother.

Nabil whooped, a sound of pure triumph. Khalil laughed, delighted by the endlessness of blue.

And Sahar just stared, trying to memorize this moment. The moment when everything changed. When they stopped being people fleeing and became people arriving.

"Look," Aunt Jalila said, pointing. "There. That's Beirut."

Down the coast, perhaps ten miles away: white buildings climbing a hillside, exactly as described in stories. A city waiting for them. A future waiting to begin.

"We walk the rest today," Mahmoud said. The merchant had come to respect the Maktabians during the journey—their endurance, their strange magic, their refusal to give up. "By sunset, you'll be in the city. And I'll have completed the strangest commission of my career: delivering a family of prophets to their destiny."

"We're not prophets," Father protested.

"Close enough."

They walked the final ten miles along the coast, and Sahar couldn't stop looking at the sea. Couldn't stop marveling that water could be so big, so blue, so impossibly alive. Waves crashed against rocks. Birds she'd never seen screamed and dove. The air tasted different here—thick with salt and possibility.

As the sun lowered, Beirut grew closer. Details emerged: buildings with red tile roofs, streets lined with palm trees, harbors full of ships. A cosmopolitan city, French-influenced, more European than anything Sahar had known.

"This is it," Aunt Jalila said. "I can feel it. The carpet's destination. The place we're supposed to be."

"Are you coming with us into the city?" Uncle Jamil asked his sister. "Or does death take you first?"

"I'm coming. I'll see you settled. Then I'll go. But not today. Today we arrive. Together."

They entered Beirut through the northern gate as the sun set, seven dusty travelers with nothing but the packs on their backs and a rolled carpet that held four centuries of history.

Somewhere in the city, a ghost named Yousef felt their arrival and began preparing to help.

Somewhere in the carpet's patterns, futures rearranged themselves, solidifying from possibility into probability.

And somewhere in little Sahar's mind, a gift fully awakened. She looked at the carpet on Father's back and saw not just cloth but destiny, not just patterns but promises.

She understood now what Aunt Jalila had meant. The carpet wasn't just inheritance. It was instruction, map, and companion. It had carried them here. It would carry them forward.

And someday, when Sahar was grown and Aunt Jalila was long dead and new challenges came, she would be the one who read it. The one who listened. The one who kept the thread going.

## The Crossing

Two days later, as they walked the final mountain pass before descending to Beirut, Aunt Jalila stopped walking.

She simply stood in the middle of the road, hand pressed to her chest, breathing shallow. Uncle Jamil turned back immediately, his face knowing.

"Sister."

"It's time," Jalila said. Her voice was calm, almost relieved. "I told you. I'd see the sea, but not the city."

They helped her to the side of the road, into the shade of an olive tree that grew improbably from the rocky soil. The family gathered—Farid, Rania, Nabil, Sahar, little Khalil—and the other travelers kept walking, uncomfortable with the intimacy of death.

Jalila looked at her twin. "You'll finish without me."

"I don't want to."

"I know. But you're stronger than you think. Always have been. You were the skeptic, the rational one. That's what the family needs now—someone who can navigate the ordinary world while Sahar navigates the magic one."

She turned to Rania. "You see ghosts. Good. I'll visit. Not often—I'll be busy with other work—but when the family needs me most, I'll be there. Listen for me."

To Sahar: "You're the next keeper. I've taught you what I could. The carpet will teach you the rest. Don't be afraid of it. Don't be afraid of the gift. It's lonely sometimes, but it's also beautiful. You get to see what others can't. That's worth the burden."

To Khalil, still weak from his illness: "You're going to be a poet. The ancestors told me. You'll write our story in verse, and it will outlive all of us. Write fearlessly. Tell the truth."

To Nabil: "You'll build the business. You'll be successful. Don't let that success separate you from your sister. You need each other—the practical and the mystical, the rememberer and the forgetter. Both are necessary."

To Farid: "Be patient. The first years in Beirut will be hard. You'll despair. But help is coming. A ghost will appear and offer you a shop. Take it. Trust him. He's family."

Her breathing became labored. Jamil held her hand, tears running down his weathered face.

"Don't cry," Jalila whispered. "I've walked through time my whole life. I've seen my own death hundreds of times—in dreams, in visions, in the carpet's patterns. I chose it. Could have stayed in Baghdad, died comfortably in a bed. But this death has meaning. I'm dying between worlds, between the old life and the new. That's right. That's proper. I'm the bridge you had to cross."

She looked at the sky, at something none of them could see. "They're here. The ancestors. Shirin's waiting. She's proud of us. Proud that we made it."

Her eyes found Sahar one last time. "Remember, child. That's your only job. Remember who we are, where we came from, what we've survived. As long as you remember, we never truly die."

Her breath stopped. The stillness was immediate and absolute.

Sahar, young as she was, could see her great-aunt's ghost separating from her body—becoming younger, straighter, glowing with the light that the newly dead sometimes carried. Ghost-Jalila looked at them all, smiled, and touched the rolled carpet that Nabil had been carrying.

"I'm in here now," her ghost said. "Woven in. Part of the pattern. I'll help from the inside."

And then she faded, dissolving into light, into memory, into the threads of the carpet itself.

They buried her there, in the mountains, wrapped in cloth they couldn't spare but gave anyway. Marked the grave with stones that would weather and scatter, the way all graves eventually did. Said prayers in Arabic because that's what they were now, officially, though Jamil whispered the old Zoroastrian words too, the ones their mother had taught him in secret.

Uncle Jamil stood longest at the grave, saying goodbye to the twin he'd shared a womb with, a lifetime with, visions with. When he finally turned away, he looked older, diminished, as if half of him had been buried with Jalila.

"We keep walking," he said. "That's what she'd want."

So they did. Down the final mountain pass, through the gate, into Beirut proper. Six days later, Jamil died in his sleep, his work complete. And Sahar understood: the twins had held on just long enough to deliver the family to safety. Their generation's task was finished.

Now came her generation's turn.

---

But that night, as the family settled in the Beirut caravanserai, Sahar was still just a nine-year-old girl who had seen her first death, smelled the sea for the first time, and understood that the hard part was over and the harder part was about to begin.

The road to the sea was complete.

Now came the work of staying.
