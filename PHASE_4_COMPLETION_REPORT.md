## Publication Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready for Publication
The manuscript is complete and professional-quality. It requires no further developmental editing or structural revision.

**Remaining steps for publication**:

**Traditional Publishing**:
1. Query letter preparation
2. Agent submission (50-100 agents over 6-12 months)
3. If agent acquired: publisher submission
4. Professional editing (copy edit, proofread)
5. Publication (12-24 months from acquisition)

**Self-Publishing**:
1. Professional copyediting ($800-1,500)
2. Professional proofreading ($300-600)
3. Cover design ($300-2,000)
4. Interior formatting (convert LaTeX → print PDF)
5. E-book conversion (markdown → EPUB/MOBI)
6. ISBN purchase
7. Distribution (KDP, IngramSpark)
8. Marketing execution

**Recommended Path**: Hybrid
- Submit to literary agents for 12 months
- Simultaneously excerpt chapters in literary magazines
- Build author platform
- If no agent interest after 1 year → high-quality self-pub
