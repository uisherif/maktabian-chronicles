Khalil Maktabian knew he would die at twenty-one, and this knowledge shaped everything he wrote.

At fifteen, he'd already filled three notebooks with poetry—verses in Arabic and Persian and French, sometimes mixing all three in the same poem, creating a linguistic tapestry that mirrored the carpet his great-great-great-grandmother had woven. His teachers at the French lycée said he was gifted. His family said he was touched. Khalil himself said he was simply listening.

"The words are already there," he explained to Sahar one evening. They were in his room—barely large enough for a bed and a small desk where he wrote—and she'd asked him about his process. "I don't create them. I hear them. From the carpet, from the ancestors, from my own future ghost. I'm just the one who writes them down."

"That sounds lonely."

"It is. But it's also beautiful. I'm seventeen years old, and I've already spoken with my death. It told me: four more years. Use them well. So that's what I'm doing."

Sahar looked at her younger brother—thin, pale, burning with something that wasn't quite fever and wasn't quite health—and felt the familiar ache of knowing he'd leave soon. She'd seen his death in the carpet's patterns: 1916, during the war, disease rather than battle. A quiet death, almost welcome, his work complete.

"What will you write about?" she asked. "In these four years?"

"Everything. The family's history encoded in verse. Our transformations, our survivals, our stubborn refusal to disappear. I'm creating a parallel archive to the carpet—one people can read without the gift. So even after the magic fades, even if future generations can't see ghosts or walk through time, they'll still have the story. They'll still know who we are."

"You're writing for people four hundred years from now."

"Yes. And they'll need it. The world is changing faster than it ever has. Technology, politics, everything. Future Maktabians will be so modern, so assimilated, they might not believe in magic anymore. But they'll still read poetry. And in my poems, they'll find themselves. They'll find us."

## The Notebook

Khalil's current project was his most ambitious: a verse cycle called "The Weavers," chronicling the family from Maktab and Shirin to the present. Forty poems, each one capturing a generation, a transformation, a threshold crossed.

He worked on it obsessively, writing in the early mornings before school and late at night when the house was quiet and the carpet's presence felt strongest. His handwriting filled pages—Arabic script flowing right to left, French words mixing in, Persian phrases appearing where Arabic failed to capture the precise emotion.

The first poem began:

*We were fire-tenders once,*
*priests of the flame that does not die.*
*We spoke in Avestan to gods*
*who answered in smoke and silence.*
*
*Then came the choice:*
*stay and fade, or leave and transform.*
*We chose transformation.*
*We always choose transformation.*

His teacher at the lycée, Monsieur Dubois, found the notebook one day when Khalil dozed off in class. Instead of punishing him, the teacher read, and his face transformed from irritation to wonder.

"Khalil," he said after class. "How old are you?"

"Seventeen, monsieur."

"You write like someone who's lived multiple lives." Dubois turned pages, fingers careful on the edges. "I want to submit these to journals. Would you allow that?"

Khalil hesitated. Publication meant exposure. But wasn't that the point? To ensure the story survived even when the family's magic faded?

"Yes," he said finally. "But on one condition. When I die—which will be soon, in the war—you must publish the complete cycle. All forty poems. It's important they stay together. They're not individual works. They're one continuous story."

"You speak of your death very casually for a seventeen-year-old."

"I've known about it since I was eight. It's not frightening anymore. Just... inevitable. A threshold I'll cross like all the others."

Monsieur Dubois looked at his student—brilliant, doomed, completely serene about it—and felt the French rationalism he'd been raised with crack slightly. There was something about this boy that suggested he really did know things he shouldn't know.

"All right," the teacher said. "I'll honor that condition. The complete cycle, published as one work. I promise."

## The Forbidden Love

Jean-Michel Rousseau was Monsieur Dubois's teaching assistant, twenty-four years old, from Paris, beautiful in the way French men sometimes were—dark curls, expressive eyes, hands that moved when he spoke. He helped grade papers, led discussion groups, and made Khalil's heart race in ways that were completely inappropriate and completely inevitable.

They'd started talking after class—Khalil asking questions about French literature, Jean-Michel offering book recommendations, their conversations extending from minutes to hours. Jean-Michel treated Khalil as an intellectual equal rather than a student, and Khalil bloomed under that attention.

"You're the most interesting person I've met in Beirut," Jean-Michel said one afternoon when they were alone in the classroom. "These poems—they're unlike anything being written in Paris right now. You're doing something completely new, mixing languages, mixing traditions. It's revolutionary."

"Or it's just writing what needs to be written."

"That's what makes it revolutionary. You're not trying to be modern. You're not imitating French styles or rejecting them. You're creating something entirely your own, born from your family's bizarre history."

"You think my family's bizarre?"

"I think your family's magical. In the literal sense. My grandmother in Brittany had the sight—saw things, predicted futures. The Church called it witchcraft, but she called it family. Your family's the same, yes? Magical practitioners hiding in plain sight?"

"Yes."

They looked at each other across the space between student and teacher, across the space between Lebanese and French, across the space between seventeen and twenty-four. And Khalil understood: Jean-Michel felt it too. This impossible attraction, this recognition of kindred spirits.

"I'm leaving Beirut in two years," Jean-Michel said quietly. "My contract ends, and I return to Paris. Nothing can happen between us. You understand that, yes?"

"I'm dying in four years. In the war. I've known since childhood. So even if something could happen, it would end anyway."

"You speak of your death the way others speak of graduation."

"Because for me, it's the same thing. A threshold, a transformation. I'm not afraid."

"But I am. I'm afraid of caring for someone who's already resigned to leaving."

"Then don't care. Or—" Khalil paused, choosing his words carefully, "—care anyway. Accept that some connections are meant to be brief. That doesn't make them less real."

Jean-Michel reached out, hesitated, then touched Khalil's hand. The briefest contact, quickly withdrawn, but enough to confirm what they both knew.

"I can't," Jean-Michel said. "It's impossible. Your age, my position, the social prohibitions—"

"I know. So we'll have this instead. Friendship. Mentorship. Hours in classrooms discussing poetry. It's not everything, but it's something. It's what we can have."

"And that's enough for you?"

"It has to be. I have four years to complete my work. I can't waste them wanting what I can't have. I accept what's possible and let go of the rest. That's what my family does. We're very good at accepting impossible limitations."

## The Final Sequence

In the last year before the war began, Khalil completed "The Weavers." Forty poems, thousands of lines, the family's entire history rendered in verse. He read them to Sahar one afternoon, his voice filling their small courtyard, and she wept at the beauty and accuracy of it.

The final poem was about her—about the keeper, the one who reads patterns, the bridge between worlds:

*She is the one who remembers*
*when everyone else has forgotten.*
*She touches the carpet and walks through centuries.*
*She speaks with the dead as easily as with the living.*
*She carries the thread forward,*
*stubborn as her ancestors,*
*refusing to let the story end.*
*
*Someday she will be old*
*and will teach her daughter*
*who will teach her daughter*
*who will teach daughters we cannot yet imagine.*
*
*And in that distant future,*
*when the family has transformed*
*beyond all recognition,*
*when they speak languages we do not know*
*and worship gods we have not met,*
*still they will be Maktabian.*
*
*Because she remembers.*
*Because she teaches.*
*Because the thread holds.*

"That's beautiful," Sahar whispered when he finished. "And terrifying. That's what I am to you? The rememberer?"

"That's what you are to all of us. Past, present, future. You're the one who makes us continuous instead of fragmented. Without you, we're just individual people living individual lives. With you, we're a story spanning centuries. That's not a small thing, sister. That's everything."

"I don't always want to be everything. Sometimes I just want to be Sahar."

"You're allowed to be both. That's what I'm trying to capture in these poems—the way we're always multiple things at once. Ancient and modern. Religious and secular. Individual and collective. All of it true, all of it simultaneous."

Khalil bound the completed manuscript himself, stitching pages together with thread from the carpet shop—symbolic and practical both. On the cover, he wrote in Arabic: "The Weavers: A Family History in Verse. By Khalil Maktabian, 1910-1912."

"This is my legacy," he told his family at dinner that night. "When I die—which will be soon, the war's coming, we all know it—this survives. And through it, you all survive. Future generations will read these poems and know: we were here. We mattered. We refused to disappear."

"Stop talking about dying," Rania said, though her voice was gentle. She'd long ago accepted that her youngest son lived with one foot in the world of the dead. "You're seventeen. You should be talking about your future."

"I am talking about my future. Just the short one I've been given. Mother, I'm not morbid. I'm practical. The carpet showed me my death years ago. I've had time to prepare, time to accept. I'm at peace with it."

"I'm not."

"I know. But you will be. When it happens, when I cross over, I won't vanish. I'll join the ancestors in the carpet. I'll be available to Sahar, to her children, to all the future keepers. Death isn't ending for people like us. It's transformation. And I'm ready to transform."

That night, Khalil added one final entry to his notebook—not a poem, but prose. Instructions for what to do with his work after his death:

*To whoever reads this: I am Khalil Maktabian. I wrote these poems between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, knowing I would die at twenty-one. This is not tragedy. This is simply my allotted time, used as well as I could use it.*

*The Weavers must be published as a complete cycle. Do not separate the poems. They are one continuous narrative, meant to be read in order.*

*Give the original manuscript to my sister Sahar. She'll need it for her work as keeper. Future keepers will need it to understand the family's history.*

*And finally: do not mourn me too much. I have lived deeply if not long. I have loved impossibly but truly. I have written what needed to be written. I am content.*

*We are the weavers. We transform and endure. I am simply one thread in a much larger pattern. My part is almost complete. The pattern continues.*

*That is enough.*

He signed it, dated it, and closed the notebook. His work was done. Now he just had to live the remaining years, love what he could love, and prepare for the transformation that waited at age twenty-one.

Four years. It would be enough.

It had to be.

Because Maktabians used whatever time they had, and they used it completely.

Even when that time was heartbreakingly brief.
