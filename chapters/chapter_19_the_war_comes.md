## August 1914

The war arrived in Beirut as news first, then as absence.

Rania heard about it in the market from a spice merchant who'd gotten word from Damascus: the Ottoman Empire had entered the Great War on the side of Germany and Austria. The European powers who'd been building presences in the Levant were now enemies. The French, including the officials and officers who'd become part of Beirut's landscape, were suddenly the opposition.

She came home with half the food she'd intended to buy—already the merchants were hoarding, anticipating shortages—and found Farid in the shop, looking grave.

"You've heard," he said.

"Yes. What does this mean for us?"

"Nothing good. The British will blockade the coast. The Ottomans will conscript men. Food will become scarce. We'll survive—we always do—but it's going to be hard."

He was right, though he didn't know how hard.

Within months, the British naval blockade cut off most of Beirut's food supply. The port that had sustained the city became useless. The Ottoman authorities requisitioned grain, olive oil, livestock—everything—leaving civilians to starve while the army ate. Locusts descended in 1915, devouring what crops remained. And then the real dying began.

By early 1915, Beirut was a city of ghosts.

Rania saw them everywhere—not just the metaphorical ghosts of the starving but actual ghosts. The dead walked the streets beside the living, not quite aware they'd crossed over, confused by the thinness of the boundary between worlds. She saw children who'd died of hunger holding their mothers' hands. Saw old men who'd succumbed to disease sitting in cafés that had closed months ago. Saw the accumulation of death that war brings, all the souls not ready to let go.

"There are so many," she told Sahar one evening. Mother and daughter both had the gift, could both see what others couldn't. "The city is more dead than alive now."

"Can we help them?"

"No. They have to cross on their own. We can only witness. And pray we don't join them."

The Maktabian family bartered carpets for bread—beautiful Persian pieces traded for loaves that were more sawdust than flour. The shop's inventory dwindled. They sold everything that wasn't the family carpet, and even that they considered, though Farid refused.

"We don't sell that. We'll starve first."

"We might starve anyway."

But they didn't. Because of the tree.

## The Tree Returns

One morning in spring 1915, Rania went to their small courtyard behind the shop and found a pomegranate tree growing there. Fully mature, heavy with fruit, impossibly present in a space that had been empty the night before.

She called the family. They gathered around the tree, staring.

"It's the same one," Sahar whispered. "From Baghdad. From Grandmother Leah's time. It's come back."

"Trees don't move," Nabil said. He was twenty-five now, practical as ever, though even his rationalism had been shaken by the war's horrors. "This is impossible."

"This is Maktabian," Rania corrected. "Impossible is our specialty."

The tree bore dozens of pomegranates, each one perfectly ripe. Rania plucked one, broke it open, and the seeds inside gleamed like rubies. She ate a handful, and power flooded through her—not magic exactly, but vitality. Strength. The ability to endure.

"Eat," she instructed the family. "The tree is here to save us. This is ancestral magic, older than the carpet. The tree appears when we need it most."

They ate the fruit, and it sustained them in ways ordinary food couldn't. One pomegranate provided energy for a week. The seeds seemed to multiply impossibly—every time Rania went to the tree, there was more fruit, regardless of season or logic.

While neighbors starved—and thousands did, perhaps a quarter of Beirut's population dying between 1915 and 1918—the Maktabians survived. Not comfortably, not easily, but alive.

"We should share," Sahar said, watching a neighbor's child, skeletal and swaying.

"We can't save everyone," Farid replied. "If we share openly, we'll be mobbed. The fruit will run out. We'll all die."

"So we let others die while we survive?"

"Yes. That's what survival means. Making hard choices. The family comes first."

It was the most difficult moral calculation Rania had ever made. She shared secretly—giving fruit to neighbors who were dying, claiming it came from a trader, never revealing the tree's existence. She saved perhaps twenty people this way. But thousands died. And she lived with that knowledge: she could have saved more. But saving more would have doomed her family.

The weight of that choice never left her.

## Conscription

In early 1916, Ottoman officials came to the shop demanding men for the army. Nabil, at twenty-six, was prime age for conscription.

"You're a merchant?" the officer asked, reviewing papers.

"Yes, effendi. Carpet merchant."

"The army needs men more than it needs carpets. You're conscripted. Report to the garrison tomorrow."

Farid stepped forward. "My son is the sole support of his family. His mother is ill. His siblings are young. Without him, we'll starve."

"Everyone's family is starving. He goes."

That night, the family held a council. The carpet was unrolled, and Sahar entered it, seeking guidance. She returned from her trance with instructions.

"We bribe them," she said. "Not with money—we have none. With carpets. The officer collects beautiful things. His house is full of stolen goods. If we give him three of our best pieces, he'll find Nabil 'essential for the war effort' and exempt him."

"Those carpets are worth—"

"Nabil's life," Rania interrupted. "They're worth Nabil's life. We give them."

So they did. Farid went to the officer with three exquisite Persian carpets, explaining that they were antiques, irreplaceable, worth a fortune. The officer examined them, calculated their value against the trouble of conscripting one more unwilling recruit, and agreed.

"Your son is exempt. But if I hear he's not contributing to the war effort, I'll conscript him anyway."

"He'll contribute. Thank you, effendi."

Nabil stayed. The carpets went. And the family survived another crisis through a combination of magic, strategy, and the willingness to pay impossible prices.

## Khalil's Death

Khalil Maktabian died on a morning in late March 1916, one week before his twenty-first birthday.

He'd been weakening for months—the famine had hit him hardest, his always-fragile body unable to sustain itself on the limited food available. The pomegranate seeds helped, but they couldn't cure the fever that finally came, the pneumonia that settled in his lungs, the weakness that no magic could fully fight.

He died at home, in his small room, with his family gathered around him. He was conscious until the end, lucid, at peace.

"I'm not afraid," he told them. "I've been preparing for this since I was eight. I know where I'm going. Into the carpet, to join the ancestors. I'll help from there. I'll whisper lines to future poets, guide future keepers. This isn't ending. It's transforming."

"I'll miss you," Sahar said, holding his hand.

"You won't. Because I'll still be here. Just invisible. You'll feel me when you read my poems. You'll hear me when you touch the carpet. I'm not leaving, sister. I'm just changing form."

To his mother: "Thank you for not trying to keep me too close to this world. For understanding that I was always partially elsewhere. That made it easier."

To his father: "You gave me space to write, to be strange, to follow the gift. That was everything."

To Nabil: "You're the practical one. Keep the family stable. Without you, the magic is just beautiful suffering. You're the foundation."

His final words were to Rania: "Tell Jean-Michel I loved him. He'll hear about my death eventually. Tell him it was as I said—not tragedy, just transformation. And thank him for treating my work seriously. The poems will outlive us all."

He smiled, closed his eyes, and was gone. The transition was so gentle that for a moment they didn't realize he'd crossed over. Then Rania and Sahar saw his ghost separate from his body—younger already, healthy, glowing with the light that the newly dead sometimes carry.

"I can see all of them," Khalil's ghost said, looking around at things the living couldn't see. "All the ancestors. They're welcoming me. Grandfather Jamil, Great-Aunt Jalila, all of them. I'm going to join them now. But I'll visit. I promise."

He faded, becoming light, becoming pattern, disappearing into the carpet that hung in the shop below. And Sahar, touching the weaving, felt him arrive. Felt him join the chorus of voices that spoke to keepers across time.

They buried him quickly—fuel for proper funeral rites was scarce—in Beirut's cemetery. The grave was marked with a simple stone: Khalil Maktabian, 1895-1916, Poet. In death as in life, his identity was his work.

Monsieur Dubois attended the funeral, along with Jean-Michel, who wept openly. After the burial, Jean-Michel approached Rania.

"He wrote about me," the young Frenchman said. "In the notebook. He said he loved me. I loved him too. I wanted you to know. I want his family to know he was loved."

"We know," Rania said gently. "He told me. And he was happy, even in impossibility. You gave him that."

"I should have given him more."

"You gave him what was possible. In his last years, during all this horror, you gave him beauty and intellectual connection and love that had to remain hidden. That was more than most people get. He died grateful."

Jean-Michel nodded, thanked her, and left. Six months later, Rania heard he'd returned to France, unable to bear Beirut without Khalil's presence.

The notebook—"The Weavers"—remained with the family. Sahar kept it, studied it, learned from it. And after the war, when publishing became possible again, she would work with Monsieur Dubois to get it printed. The forty poems would be published as one volume in 1921, dedicated "To the ancestors, who remember everything."

But that was later. In spring 1916, they simply mourned, continued surviving, and felt Khalil's ghost guiding them through the rest of the war.

## Survival

The final two years of the war were grinding endurance.

The blockade continued. Food remained scarce. The Ottoman authorities grew more desperate, more brutal. Armenians were deported through Beirut, dying in the streets, their genocide playing out in real time while the world looked away.

Rania witnessed horrors she couldn't speak about even years later. Saw children eating grass. Saw neighbors killing neighbors over crusts of bread. Saw the city transform into something feral, desperate, barely human.

But the Maktabians survived. The pomegranate tree provided sustenance. Khalil's ghost warned them of raids, helped them hide what little they had. The carpet seemed to protect them—customers who would have been dangerous walked past their shop without seeing it, as if it were camouflaged.

"The magic is strong now," Sahar observed. "Stronger than it's been in generations. Why?"

"Because we need it," Rania replied. "Magic responds to necessity. We're at the edge of not-surviving. So the magic does everything it can to keep us alive."

Farid aged twenty years in four. Nabil lost half his body weight. Sahar spent so much time in trance, seeking guidance, that she could barely function in the ordinary world. And Rania herself became a ghost among ghosts, seeing more dead than living, conversing with both, losing track of which world she primarily inhabited.

But they survived.

In November 1918, the armistice came. The war ended. The British and French occupied the region. The Ottoman Empire collapsed. A new world began.

The Maktabians stood in their shop—depleted, traumatized, but alive—and took inventory.

Farid, aged sixty. Rania, fifty-eight. Nabil, twenty-nine. Sahar, twenty-six. And the ghosts: Khalil, Grandfather Jamil, Great-Aunt Jalila, all the ancestors watching from the carpet.

"We survived," Farid said, and his voice broke on the word. "Again. We always survive."

"Yes," Rania agreed. "Though I'm not sure survival is always a gift. Sometimes it's just a requirement we fulfill."

"What do we do now?"

Sahar touched the carpet, seeking guidance. The patterns showed her: rebuild, recover, remember. The family's work wasn't done. The thread had to continue. New generations needed to be born, new stories needed to be woven.

"We keep going," she said. "Because that's what Maktabians do. We endure. We transform. We refuse to disappear. Even when it would be easier to give up. Even when survival costs more than dying. We keep going."

"I'm very tired," Rania said quietly.

"I know, Mother. So am I. But we keep going anyway."

Outside, Beirut began the slow work of reconstruction. Inside the shop, the family did the same. Healing what could be healed. Mourning what was lost. Preparing for whatever came next.

The war had taken Khalil, had taken their wealth, had taken their innocence about the world's capacity for cruelty.

But it hadn't taken them.

And in the end, that was enough.

It had to be.

Because the alternative—giving up, disappearing, letting the thread break—was unthinkable.

They were Maktabians.

And Maktabians survived.

Always.
