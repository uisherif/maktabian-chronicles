The arak burned going down, which was the point. Hassan Maktabian tilted the clay cup back and let the fire erase the day, the week, the decade of failures that had brought him to this tavern in Baghdad's river quarter, where men came to forget they were men.

"Another," he said, pushing the cup across the scarred wooden table.

The tavern keeper—a massive Kurd with more scar than face—refilled it from a jug that had no label and needed none. Arak was arak: anise-flavored fire that cost two fils and erased memory for an hour or two. In a proper establishment, Hassan couldn't afford it. But this place, this cave of desperate men and watered spirits, he could just manage.

"You should go home," said the man beside him. Hassan didn't know his name. They'd been drinking together for weeks and never exchanged names. That was the etiquette of places like this.

"Home is where they remind me I'm a failure," Hassan said. "Here, everyone's a failure. It's companionable."

"You've got kids. Wife."

"Which makes it worse, doesn't it? Better to fail alone than drag others down with you."

The nameless man grunted and returned to his own cup, his own private disaster. Around them, the tavern hummed with low conversation and the smell of bodies and smoke and spirits. No women, of course. No one who mattered. Just the wreckage of men, drinking away the gap between who they'd meant to be and who they'd become.

Hassan was forty-three years old. He'd inherited his father's carpet repair business at twenty, full of ambition and unrealistic optimism. He'd married Leah when he was twenty-five—a good match, a woman from a family of small merchants, practical and kind. They'd had four children, two of whom survived infancy.

And then, slowly, inexorably, he'd failed at everything.

Bad decisions. Worse luck. A shipment of wool that arrived rotten. A wealthy client who refused to pay, claimed the work was shoddy, sued successfully. A fire that gutted half the shop. Debt that accumulated like sediment at the river's bottom. And through it all, Hassan's slow descent into the bottle, because the bottle was the only place where failure felt like a choice instead of a verdict.

"Your family has that carpet, doesn't it?" the nameless man asked suddenly. "The old one. Persian."

Hassan stiffened. "How do you know about that?"

"Everyone knows. It's famous in the quarter. Ancient thing, worth a fortune supposedly. But your family won't sell it." The man leaned closer, breath sour with arak. "Why not? You're drowning in debt. That carpet could save you."

"It's family. Heirloom. Going back centuries."

"Centuries of what? Other failures? Does it make you feel better, knowing your ancestors were as hopeless as you?"

Hassan wanted to hit him. Wanted to defend the carpet, his family, himself. But the man was right, wasn't he? The carpet was just proof that the Maktabians had been losing slowly for generations. What was there to protect?

"My father said never to sell it. Said it was important. That it knew things."

"Knew things? It's wool and dye."

"I know. I know. But I promised him. On his deathbed, I promised."

"Promises to the dead don't feed the living."

Hassan drank again, deeper this time, chasing oblivion. But tonight, oblivion wouldn't come. His mind kept circling back to the carpet, rolled up in the corner of their single room, taking up space that could be used for something practical. Leah wanted to sell it. His son Jamil, twelve years old and already more sensible than his father, had suggested it too.

Only Hassan refused. And he couldn't even explain why.

"I should go," he said, standing unsteadily.

"You'll come back tomorrow," the nameless man said. It wasn't a question.

"Probably."

The walk home was a blur of narrow streets and darkness. Baghdad at night was dangerous if you looked like you had anything worth stealing, but Hassan looked like exactly what he was: a drunk stumbling home with empty pockets. No one bothered him.

The room was dark when he arrived. Leah and the children asleep on mats arranged around the carpet, which they'd unrolled to serve as both floor covering and reminder of better times. Hassan stood in the doorway, swaying slightly, looking at his family sleeping.

Leah's face was lined with worry and work. She was thirty-eight but looked fifty. Their son Jamil slept with his arm thrown over his little sister Jalila, protective even in sleep. The twins had been born seven years ago, unexpected and terrifying, another burden Hassan couldn't provide for properly. But they'd survived, and Jamil had taken to helping raise Jalila, compensating for his father's absence.

Good kids. Better than they deserved. Better than he deserved.

Hassan stumbled to his sleeping mat, lay down on the carpet's edge, and passed into something between sleep and unconsciousness.

And dreamed.

---

In the dream, he was sober. That was the first strange thing. His mind was clear, his thoughts ordered, his body steady. He stood in the room, but it was different—larger, the walls glowing faintly with light that had no source.

The carpet beneath his feet was alive.

Not moving, exactly. But aware. Conscious. Looking at him through its patterns, seeing him in a way he hadn't been seen in years. Really seen, not just glanced at and dismissed.

"You're a disappointment," the carpet said. Not with voice, but with knowing, the words appearing in his mind fully formed.

"I know," Hassan said.

"Your father was a disappointment. His father was mediocre. The family has been declining for generations. You're just the latest iteration of slow collapse."

"I know that too."

"But you're useful," the carpet said. "Even failures serve the pattern. Especially failures. The desperate are easier to move."

"Move where?"

The carpet rippled, and Hassan felt himself falling into it, through it, into the pattern itself. Colors swirled around him—reds and blues and golds forming and reforming into images.

He saw a city he didn't recognize. White buildings climbing a hillside. Blue water—the sea, though he'd never seen the sea except in pictures. Mountains in the background. Ships in a harbor. People in streets speaking a language he didn't know but somehow understood: Arabic, but not Baghdad Arabic. Something coastal. Mediterranean.

"Where is this?" he asked the dream.

"West. On the sea. Your grandchildren will carry me there. Will build a new life. Will restore what you've lost."

"I don't have grandchildren."

"Not yet. But you will. Jamil will have a son. That son will have children. They'll leave Baghdad. They'll walk west until they find the sea. And I'll guide them."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because you need to keep me. You wanted to sell me tonight—I felt it. The arak made you brave enough to consider it. But you can't. No matter how desperate you become, no matter what Leah says, no matter how sensible it seems. You keep me. You pass me to Jamil. And he passes me forward."

"We're starving. The carpet could—"

"The carpet will save you a different way. Not by being sold, but by being kept. Trust this: your family survives. Not you—you'll drink yourself to death within ten years. Not your wife—she'll work herself into an early grave. But your children survive. Your grandchildren thrive. All because they carry me forward."

Hassan wanted to argue, to demand proof, to refuse the carpet's certainty. But the vision wrapped around him, insistent and overwhelming. He saw Jamil as an old man, beard gray, holding the carpet in a room with walls made of stone. He saw a woman—Jamil's granddaughter?—with green eyes, tracing patterns on the carpet's surface, understanding what Hassan had never understood.

He saw continuity. Despite everything, the thread held.

"Why us?" he whispered. "We've been falling apart for generations. Why do we deserve to continue?"

"Deserve?" The carpet's voice carried something like amusement. "This isn't about deserving. It's about stubbornness. Your family refuses to disappear. You transform, you adapt, you lose everything and cling to the one thing that remembers. That's not virtue. It's just stubbornness. But stubbornness is enough."

The dream released him. Hassan woke on the floor of his room, the morning sun slanting through the single small window. His head ached, his mouth tasted of ash and anise, and his family was already awake around him.

Leah looked at him with disappointment so familiar it no longer hurt.

"You'll sleep all day again," she said. Not angry. Just tired.

"No." Hassan sat up, instantly regretting it as pain lanced through his skull. "No, I need to... I need to look at something."

He crawled to where the carpet was rolled in the corner—they'd rolled it after he passed out, needing the space. He unrolled it carefully, his hands shaking but reverent.

In the morning light, the patterns seemed different. More insistent. He'd looked at this carpet his entire life, had slept on it, walked on it, ignored it. But he'd never really seen it.

Now he saw.

Text woven so small it was almost invisible. Figures that might have been his ancestors or might have been prophecy. And there, if he looked at just the right angle: a city on a hillside above blue water. The exact city from his dream.

"It's real," he whispered.

"What's real?" Jamil asked. The boy knelt beside his father, looking at the carpet. "What do you see?"

"Our future. Your future." Hassan looked at his son, this twelve-year-old with eyes already too serious. "Jamil, I'm going to tell you something, and you're going to think I'm drunk or crazy. Maybe I am. But listen anyway."

---

The obsession started that morning and never stopped.

Hassan became convinced the carpet was prophetic, that it held the family's destiny in its patterns, that understanding it was the key to everything. He stopped going to the tavern—not because he'd reformed, but because the carpet gave him something arak couldn't: purpose, even if that purpose was mad.

He took the carpet to dealers in Baghdad's best souq, asking them to examine it, price it, tell him its history. Every dealer who looked at it said roughly the same thing:

"Very old. Isfahan work, possibly sixteenth century or earlier. Extraordinary quality. The dyes are natural, very pure. The patterns are unusual—I've never seen quite this combination of motifs. Worth a significant sum."

"How much?"

Numbers were named. Amounts that could clear Hassan's debts twice over, rent a proper house, restart the business. Life-changing amounts.

"I'll sell it," Hassan would say, and every dealer would nod and begin calculating. But then, as they reached for the carpet, as the transaction neared completion, something would happen.

The first dealer hesitated, touching the patterns, then pulled his hand back as if burned. "Actually, I... I don't think I want it. Sorry. Wrong time to make such a large purchase."

The second dealer examined it for an hour, seemed ready to buy, then suddenly said: "It's wrong. Something's wrong with it. I can't say what, but I don't want it in my shop. It makes me uncomfortable."

The third dealer looked at it, looked at Hassan, and said: "This isn't meant to be sold. I don't know how I know that, but I know it. Take it home. Keep it. It's not for me."

After the fifth dealer refused—each one finding a different reason not to complete the purchase—Hassan stopped trying to sell it.

"It won't let itself be sold," he told Leah that night. "The carpet wants to stay with us."

"Carpets don't want things. They're objects."

"This one does. I felt it. Every dealer felt it. It's... it's not just a carpet, Leah. It's alive somehow. Conscious. It knows."

Leah looked at him with the particular exhaustion of a woman watching her husband descend into new madness. "You've stopped drinking and started believing in magic. I'm not sure which is worse."

"I'm not drinking because I don't need to anymore. The carpet gave me something to do."

"It gave you a different way to avoid providing for your family."

Maybe she was right. Hassan's business didn't improve. The debts didn't vanish. They still lived in one room, still ate poorly, still struggled day to day. But Hassan had stopped drowning. He'd grabbed onto something—even if that something was a delusion about a prophetic carpet—and it was keeping his head above water.

He spent hours studying the patterns, trying to decode them. He'd never learned to read properly—a few words of Arabic, nothing more—but he convinced himself he could read the carpet's language without literacy. It spoke in colors and shapes, in the way certain patterns made him feel. He began to see things: journeys, transformations, faces of descendants he'd never meet.

"You're going to Beirut," he told Jamil one evening. The boy was fourteen now, already working to help support the family, already more man than child. "Not you, but your children. Or your grandchildren. They're going to walk west until they reach the sea, and they're going to build something there. The carpet showed me."

"Father..." Jamil's voice was gentle, the gentleness of a son who's learned to manage a father who can't manage himself. "The carpet is cloth. It doesn't show anything."

"It does. You just can't see it yet. But you will. Someday, when you have to make the choice to leave or stay, you'll look at the carpet and it will tell you: leave. Go west. And you'll go, because the carpet is never wrong."

Jamil didn't argue. He'd learned that arguing with his father's obsessions was pointless. Better to nod and let the madness pass.

But Hassan knew—or thought he knew, which for him was the same thing—that he'd been chosen to receive the vision specifically because he was a failure. The successful didn't need prophecy. The comfortable didn't dream of escape. Only the desperate were desperate enough to believe that a carpet could speak.

And in his desperation, he'd heard it. And hearing it had given him something to live for beyond the next drink.

---

Ten years later, Hassan lay dying of liver disease. He was fifty-three years old but looked seventy. His body had turned yellow, his belly swollen with fluid, his mind drifting in and out of clarity. Leah had gone five years earlier—worked herself literally to death, just as the carpet had predicted. His daughter Jalila lived in another city now, married to a merchant. Only Jamil remained, now twenty-four, with a wife of his own and a baby son.

They'd named the baby Farid. Hassan had held him once, this tiny new life, and seen in the infant's face the possibility of continuity. The thread extending forward.

"Jamil," Hassan whispered from his mat. His son leaned close to hear. "The carpet."

"I have it, Father. It's safe."

"Don't sell it. No matter what. Promise me."

"I promise."

"It will tell you when to leave. You'll know. You'll hear it, the way I heard it. Maybe not the same way, but you'll know."

"Leave Baghdad?"

"When the time comes. The carpet knows when. It will show you. Maybe in a dream, maybe some other way. But you'll know."

Jamil held his father's yellowed hand. "I'll listen for it."

"Your son. Farid. He's part of this. The carpet showed me. His children will see the sea. Will build something new. Everything we lost, they'll recover. Not the same way, but they'll recover it."

"All right, Father. I believe you."

Hassan smiled weakly. He knew Jamil didn't believe, not really. But the boy was kind enough to pretend, and maybe that kindness would be enough to keep the promise.

"I was a failure," Hassan said. "I know that. Wasted my life in taverns, couldn't provide for your mother, for you. But I did one thing right. I kept the carpet. I listened when it spoke. That's my contribution. That's all I have to offer."

"You did more than that."

"No. But it's enough. Failing isn't the end, Jamil. Forgetting is the end. As long as we remember who we are, as long as we keep the carpet, we can fail a thousand times and still continue."

He died that night, quietly, without drama. Jamil washed his body according to Muslim custom, buried him in Baghdad's cemetery, said the prayers. At the funeral, few people came. Hassan hadn't been important enough to warrant a large attendance. Just family and a handful of his father's old acquaintances, paying respects more to continuity than to the man.

But when Jamil returned home to the small house he'd rented with his wife and son, he unrolled the carpet for the first time in years. Looked at it properly, the way his father had in his final decade, searching for meaning in its patterns.

He saw nothing. Just beautiful old weaving, intricate and valuable but silent.

But as he stood to roll it up again, his infant son Farid began to cry. Jamil picked him up, bouncing him gently, and the baby reached out one small hand toward the carpet.

His tiny fingers brushed a pattern. And for just a moment, Jamil could have sworn the colors shifted. Brightened. Responded.

He told himself it was a trick of the light. Told himself his father's madness wasn't hereditary. Told himself the carpet was an object, beautiful but inert, worth keeping for sentimental and financial reasons but not magical.

But in the back of his mind, a seed had been planted. A possibility. A question.

What if his father hadn't been entirely mad? What if the carpet really did know things? What if, someday, it really would tell them when to leave?

He rolled it up carefully, stored it in the trunk his father had built, and locked it away. But now, for the first time, he didn't lock it away as useless heritage. He locked it away as something precious. Dangerous, maybe. Certainly strange.

But precious.

And when the time came—decades later, when he was old and his children grown and the carpet whispered in his dreams of blue water and white stone—he would remember his father's words.

*It will tell you when to leave. Listen.*

And he would listen.

Because even failures serve the pattern.

Especially failures.
