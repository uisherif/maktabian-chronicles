- Dark eyes that seem to see past surfaces
- Hands stained with ink and soot from sacred fires
- Prematurely gray hair from fasting and study

**Personality**:
- Intellectual, strategic, pragmatic
- Spiritual but not dogmatic: "God has many names"
- Curious about other faiths: reads Hebrew texts, studies with Jewish merchants
- Torn between honoring ancestors and surviving in new world
- Makes conversion seem rational, but privately grieves loss

**Character Arc**:
- Begins as dutiful priest tending dying tradition
- Meets Jewish merchant travelers, fascinated by their resilience
- Falls in love with Shirin (fire temple keeper's daughter)
- Decides: conversion is survival, not betrayal

- Weaves the first carpet with Shirin—encodes both faiths in it
- Dies content: family will survive him

**Key Relationships**:
- **Shirin** (wife): spiritual partner, co-creator of magic

- **His father** (dying priest): blesses him but with sorrow: "You leave us, but you carry the fire inside"

**Magical Connection**:
- Can read ancient Avestan texts that predict futures
- Transfers this ability into carpet he weaves
- When he prays, whether Zoroastrian or Jewish, he feels the same presence

## Character Development Rules (Across Generations)

### Patterns to Maintain

1. **Each generation has:**
   - A "rememberer" (keeps family history alive)
   - A "forgetter" (wants to move forward, not back)
   - A magical practitioner (varies in strength)
   - A skeptic or rationalist
   - Someone who dies young (price of survival)

2. **Names echo across generations:**
   - Shirin reappears as middle name
   - Yousef/Yousouf repeats
   - "J" names recur: Jamil, Jalila, [implied future generations]

3. **Physical traits recur:**
   - Green eyes (Shirin's) appear randomly
   - Small, strong hands (weavers)
   - Premature gray hair
   - Tendency to thinness

4. **Magical ability:**
   - Strongest in women (Shirin, Jalila, Sahar, Rania)
   - Skips generations sometimes
   - Strongest in times of crisis
   - Always connected to the carpet

5. **Each generation has forbidden/doomed love:**
   - Shirin and Maktab (cross-religious, but succeeds)
   - Character in Isfahan and Muslim girl (fails)
   - Sahar and Beaumont (fails)
   - Others implied

6. **Relationship to religion:**
   - Generation 1: Zoroastrian→Jewish
   - Generation 2: Jewish (comfortable)
   - Generation 3: Jewish→Muslim (forced)
   - Generation 4-5: Ambiguously Muslim/Jewish (syncretism)
   - Generation 6: Secular but traditional (spirituality not religion)

## Supporting Characters (Not Family)

### Rav Shmuel (Generation 1)
- Jewish merchant who teaches Maktab Torah
- Patient, kind, wise
- Represents Jewish acceptance of converts

### Lieutenant Beaumont (Generation 6)
- French officer in Beirut, early 20th century
- Falls for Sahar: genuine love, not colonial exploitation
- But impossible: different worlds
- Leaves Beirut, never returns
- Represents path Sahar doesn't take

### The Neighbors (Various)
- Muslim, Christian, Druze neighbors in Beirut
- Show cosmopolitan texture of city
- Some kind, some prejudiced, all human

*Characters should surprise us as we write. These profiles are guides, not prisons. Trust the characters to reveal themselves.*
