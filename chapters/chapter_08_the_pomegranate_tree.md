Leah woke to birdsong, which was wrong. Their courtyard had never had birds—too small, too enclosed, nothing green to attract them. But this morning, the sound was unmistakable: dozens of birds singing in chorus, celebrating something.

She sat up on her sleeping mat, joints aching. Sixty-three years old, worn down by poverty and work and the particular exhaustion of having outlived a disappointing husband. Hassan had been dead five years now, and Leah had spent those years helping raise her grandchildren—the twins, Jamil and Jalila, now fifteen years old and the brightest lights in her diminished life.

The birds sang louder. Insistent.

Leah rose, wrapped her shawl around her shoulders against the morning chill, and walked to the courtyard.

Then stopped, breath catching in her throat.

In the center of their small courtyard—where yesterday had been only packed earth and the clay water jars—stood a pomegranate tree. Not a sapling. A tree, perhaps twenty years old, its trunk thick as her thigh, its branches spreading wide and heavy with dark green leaves. And hanging from those branches, impossibly: ripe fruit, dozens of pomegranates in deep ruby red, their skin splitting slightly to reveal the seeds within.

Birds covered every branch—sparrows and doves and a single hoopoe with its distinctive crest, all singing as if this were the most natural thing in the world.

Leah stood frozen, trying to make sense of what she was seeing. She was old but not senile. She knew their courtyard. She'd swept this space yesterday evening. There had been no tree. Trees didn't grow overnight. Certainly not fully mature trees bearing fruit.

"Grandmother?"

Jalila emerged from the house, rubbing sleep from her eyes. Then she saw the tree and stopped, her expression transforming from drowsy confusion to wide-eyed wonder.

"Where did that come from?" the girl whispered.

"I don't know."

Jamil appeared behind his sister, and his response was more skeptical. "Someone's playing a trick. They must have planted it in the night. Dug a hole, transplanted a mature tree—"

"Look at the ground," Leah said.

They looked. The earth around the tree's base showed no sign of disturbance. No broken soil, no evidence of digging. The tree simply was, as if it had always been there, reality rearranging itself around its existence.

"This is impossible," Jamil said firmly. He was the practical twin, the rationalist, the one who would become a carpet repairer like his father but without the drinking, without the failure. "There's an explanation. There has to be."

But Jalila—dreamy, strange Jalila who sleepwalked and saw things that weren't there and frightened the neighbors with her knowing eyes—walked straight to the tree and placed her hand on its trunk.

"It's the same," she said softly. "The same tree from the old stories. Grandmother Shirin's tree, the one that appeared when she was weaving the carpet. It's come back."

"That's impossible," Jamil repeated, but with less certainty.

Leah's mind raced through stories her mother-in-law had told her, fragments Hassan had mentioned in his rambling last years. Something about a pomegranate tree that appeared to the family at significant moments. Something about magic, prophecy, transformation. She'd dismissed it as folklore, the kind of stories families told to make their ordinary histories seem special.

But the tree in front of her was not ordinary.

"Don't touch the fruit," she said sharply as Jalila reached toward a low-hanging pomegranate. "Not yet. Not until we understand what this is."

They spent the morning trying to understand. Jamil examined the tree with methodical skepticism, looking for evidence of trickery. He found none. The roots appeared to go deep—when he dug carefully at the base, he found thick taproots that would have taken years to establish. The trunk showed growth rings when he peeled back a small section of bark. Everything about the tree suggested it had been growing there for decades.

"It's been here the whole time," Jalila said, "and we just couldn't see it. Now we can. That's the magic—not that it appeared, but that it revealed itself."

"That makes even less sense than it appearing overnight," Jamil protested.

"Magic doesn't follow sense. It follows need."

Leah said nothing, but she felt the truth of her granddaughter's words. Something had changed. Some threshold had been crossed. The family needed the tree now, needed whatever it had to offer, and so it had stopped hiding.

By afternoon, neighbors had gathered at their door, drawn by rumor of the impossible tree. Leah let them look but wouldn't let them touch, claiming she needed to consult with religious authorities about whether the tree was blessing or curse. In truth, she needed time to decide what to do.

As the sun set and the twins prepared dinner, Leah stood alone in the courtyard, looking at the tree in the failing light. The pomegranates seemed to glow faintly, lit from within by something that wasn't quite light.

"What do you want from us?" she asked the tree softly.

The tree rustled, though there was no wind.

Leah reached up and plucked a single pomegranate from a low branch. It came away easily, heavy in her hand, warm as if it were alive. She carried it inside, closed the door, and sat down in the lamplight.

The twins watched as she broke the fruit open. The seeds inside gleamed like rubies, like blood, like promises. Leah had eaten thousands of pomegranates in her life—it was common fruit, nothing magical. But these seeds looked different. They looked like they contained something more than juice and sweetness.

"Grandmother," Jamil said quietly. "Maybe you shouldn't—"

But Leah had already eaten a handful of seeds. They burst on her tongue, tart and sweet and something else entirely. And then the world disappeared.

---

She stood in Isfahan. Knew it was Isfahan though she'd never been there, knew it was centuries ago though she'd never seen it. The air smelled of rosewater and smoke, and sunlight fell through ornamental windows onto a courtyard where a woman sat at a loom.

The woman had green eyes and moved with absolute certainty, her hands weaving patterns that seemed to write themselves. This was Shirin. Leah knew it the way you know things in dreams—with complete conviction.

She watched Shirin weave the carpet that would become her family's inheritance. Watched Maktab sit beside her, telling stories, feeding the weaving with memory. Watched the pomegranate tree in their courtyard—the same tree, younger but unmistakably the same—bear fruit that Shirin and Maktab ate together, visions passing between them.

Then the scene shifted.

She saw Yousef the goldsmith in his workshop, gold dust floating in sunlight, prosperity and security and the fear underneath that it wouldn't last. Saw him write his warning in a hidden book, trying to leave some message for descendants he'd never meet.

She saw the forced conversion. Saw Ibrahim and David splitting, one going toward Islam, one staying Jewish, the family fracturing along religious lines. Saw the pain of that split, the bitterness and love tangled together.

She saw migrations, always westward. Isfahan to Baghdad, waves of movement, each generation losing more wealth, more status, more memory of who they'd been.

She saw her own husband Hassan as a young man, before alcohol and failure had marked him, his face open and hopeful in a way she'd never witnessed in life. Saw the moment when hope had curdled into despair.

And she saw her grandchildren—Jamil and Jalila—older, walking through desert, carrying the carpet between them. Saw them reach a city by the sea. Saw Jalila die on that journey, saw Jamil weeping over her body. Saw the family that would come after: children and grandchildren who would speak Arabic and French, who would be neither Persian nor fully Arab, who would carry the carpet into a future she couldn't quite see.

The visions came faster, overlapping. Centuries condensed into moments. Every forced conversion, every voluntary one. Every journey, every loss, every stubborn act of survival. The family transformed constantly but never disappeared, each generation choosing life over purity, continuity over consistency.

And through it all: the carpet, rolled and unrolled and rolled again. The pomegranate tree, appearing and disappearing. The thread that held everything together, even when everything else frayed.

When Leah returned to herself, she was lying on the floor of her room. Jamil supported her head, his face frightened. Jalila held her hand, looking less frightened and more knowing.

"You saw," Jalila said. Not a question.

"Everything. I saw everything."

"How long was I gone?" Leah asked.

"Minutes," Jamil said. "You ate the seeds, your eyes rolled back, you collapsed. We thought—" His voice broke. "We thought you were dying."

"I was traveling. Through time. Through memory." Leah sat up slowly, her body feeling strange, heavy with knowledge it hadn't carried before. "Help me to the courtyard. I need to touch the tree again."

They helped her outside. Full night now, stars visible through the courtyard's opening, the tree a dark shape against the sky. But the pomegranates glowed softly, providing their own light.

Leah placed both hands on the trunk and felt the tree respond. Not with words, but with presence. Ancient and patient, carrying memory in its roots, in its sap, in its impossible fruit.

"You're the family's memory keeper," Leah said to the tree. "When we forget, you remember. When we're lost, you show us the way back. Or the way forward."

The tree rustled in agreement.

"Why now? Why appear now, after a century of hiding?"

The tree's answer came not in words but in feeling: Because the time is coming. The great journey westward. The twins need to know who they are before they become who they'll be. You need to teach them what you've learned.

Leah understood. The tree had given her the gift of complete family memory specifically so she could pass it on to Jamil and Jalila before she died. She was the bridge between forgetting and remembering.

"Sit," she told her grandchildren. "I need to tell you a story. The whole story, from the beginning."

They sat beneath the tree, and Leah began to speak.

---

She told them about Maktab and Shirin in Isfahan, Zoroastrians who converted to Judaism not from coercion but from love and curiosity and a sense that transformation was survival. Told them about the carpet Shirin wove, imbuing it with prophecy, with visions of the family's future.

She told them about Yousef the goldsmith, prosperous and doomed, who would someday become a ghost to help his descendants. About the forced conversion that split the family between Ibrahim's pragmatic Islam and David's stubborn Judaism. About the migrations to Baghdad, the slow decline, the poverty that had defined their recent generations.

"Hassan—your grandfather—was a drunk and a failure," Leah said bluntly, "but he wasn't wrong about the carpet. It does speak. It does know things. He heard it in his dreams because he was desperate enough to listen. And what it told him was true: you two will leave Baghdad. You'll carry the carpet west. One of you will die on the journey—"

"No," Jamil said, reaching for his sister's hand.

"Yes. I saw it. I'm sorry. But the other will make it to a city by the sea, and there the family will begin again. Will build something new. You'll have children, grandchildren. They'll forget the Persian language, forget Isfahan, forget most of this history. But they'll keep the carpet. And someday, someone with the gift will read it again and remember everything."

"Which of us dies?" Jalila asked quietly.

"I couldn't see clearly. The vision showed me both possibilities, layered over each other. Maybe it's not fixed yet. Maybe there's still choice." But Leah suspected it was Jalila—the dreamy one, the seer, the one who walked between worlds too easily to stay anchored in this one for long.

"When do we leave?" Jamil asked. "How do we know when?"

"The carpet will tell you. The way it told your grandfather. You'll dream of the sea, of white stone buildings, of fruit trees you've never seen. And when you dream that dream repeatedly, when it becomes more real than Baghdad, you'll know: it's time."

They sat in silence, processing. The tree's branches swayed gently overhead, and pomegranates glowed like small lamps, casting red shadows.

"Why us?" Jamil asked finally. "Why does our family get magic? We're nobody. We've been nobody for generations."

"That's exactly why," Leah said. "The great families, the wealthy families—they write history. They don't need magic to be remembered. But families like ours? Poor, displaced, constantly transforming? Without magic, we'd disappear completely. The carpet, the tree, the visions—they're not gifts. They're survival tools. Ways of holding onto identity when everything else is stripped away."

"So we're not special," Jalila said. "Just stubborn."

"The most stubborn. We refuse to disappear. Even when the world tells us we should, even when it would be easier. We transform, we adapt, but we don't vanish. That's what the carpet knows. That's what it protects."

Leah plucked three more pomegranates from the tree and handed one to each twin, keeping one for herself. "Eat. Receive the memory. You need to carry it with you, not just as story I told you, but as lived experience. The seeds will give you what they gave me."

The twins exchanged glances, uncertain. But they trusted their grandmother—strange as she'd become, mad as this all seemed—and they ate.

Leah watched their eyes glaze as the visions took them. Watched them travel through centuries, seeing their ancestors, understanding the pattern. When they returned to themselves, both were weeping.

"It's real," Jamil whispered. "All of it. The carpet, the prophecy, the journey. It's real."

"I saw her," Jalila said. "Shirin. She spoke to me. Said I was the bridge. That I'd carry them from past into future, even if I didn't complete the journey myself."

So it would be Jalila who died. Leah had suspected, but hearing it confirmed made her chest tight with grief. This strange, gifted granddaughter who saw too much and felt too deeply—of course the journey would cost her. Magic always demanded payment.

"Don't fear your death," Leah said gently, taking Jalila's hand. "I saw you afterward. You become a guide. You help the family from the other side. Your brother will need you, and you'll be there."

"That's supposed to comfort me?" But Jalila smiled slightly. "I suppose it does. Better to die meaning something than live meaning nothing."

"You'll both mean something," Leah said firmly. "You're the generation that moves. That breaks the stagnation. That gives the family a future instead of just a past."

They stayed in the courtyard until dawn, talking, asking questions, with Leah answering what she could and admitting what she couldn't. The tree listened, the birds that had gathered in its branches listened, and perhaps the ancestors listened too, pleased that memory was being restored, that the chain wasn't broken.

---

Leah lived another three months after the tree appeared. Long enough to teach the twins everything she knew, to make them practice telling the family stories until they could recite them perfectly, to ensure the knowledge would survive her death.

The pomegranate tree stayed, its presence slowly becoming normal to the neighborhood. People came to marvel at it less and less, and eventually it was just another tree in another courtyard, except this one bore fruit year-round and never lost its leaves.

On the night she died, Leah called the twins to her bedside one final time.

"The carpet is in the chest by the wall," she said, her voice thin with exhaustion. "Your father Jamil knows its importance, but he doesn't fully believe. You'll have to convince him when the time comes. Show him the patterns, make him eat the pomegranate seeds if you must. He'll resist—he's practical like his father was before the drink took him—but he'll listen eventually."

"We will," Jamil promised.

"Jalila." Leah took the girl's hand. "You'll die young, but not soon. You'll have years yet. Use them to practice your gift. Learn to walk in dreams, to see across time. You'll need that skill to guide your brother after you're gone."

"I'm not afraid," Jalila said, and she meant it.

"Good. Fear would waste your remaining time." Leah looked between them, these two fifteen-year-old children who'd been given impossible knowledge, impossible destinies. "I wish I could see where you end up. The city by the sea. I wish I could know your grandchildren."

"Maybe you will," Jalila said. "If I can guide from the other side, maybe you can too. Maybe we'll all be there, all the ancestors, walking beside the family even after we die."

"Maybe." Leah smiled. "That would be nice. A very crowded, very loud family of living and dead, all arguing about the best route to take."

She died an hour later, peacefully, with her grandchildren holding her hands. They buried her according to Muslim custom—the family was functionally Muslim now, though they maintained some Jewish practices privately, and Leah herself had been so syncretic that categorizing her faith was impossible.

At her grave, Jalila said: "She saw everything. The past, the future, all of us at once. That's not a curse. That's a gift."

"It drove her a little mad," Jamil observed.

"Maybe. But she was happy, these last months. She had purpose. She knew she'd restored something that was almost lost."

They returned home to find the pomegranate tree had grown—not much, but noticeably. Its trunk was thicker, its branches fuller. And hanging from every branch: new fruit, fresh and glowing.

"It approves," Jalila said. "The memory has been passed on. The tree can rest now until the next threshold."

"Do you think it will come with us?" Jamil asked. "When we leave for the sea?"

"No. It will stay here, wait for whoever comes next, whoever needs it. Or maybe it will appear there, at the sea, when we arrive. Who knows? Magic doesn't follow rules we understand."

They plucked two pomegranates, ate them slowly, letting the seeds' sweetness and memory mix on their tongues. And they felt their grandmother's presence—not as ghost, not yet, but as memory, as knowledge, as the feeling of being watched over by someone who'd seen the pattern and approved of their place in it.

The house of forgetting had become the house of remembering.

And the twins who would carry that remembering westward sat beneath an impossible tree, eating impossible fruit, preparing for an impossible journey.

Because that's what Maktabians did.

The impossible. Again and again. Until it became possible through sheer stubborn repetition.

The tree rustled in agreement.

And the stars wheeled overhead, counting down the decades until the twins would leave, until the prophecy would continue, until the carpet would hang in a window overlooking blue water and white stone, waiting for the next generation to read its patterns and remember.
