The old woman was dying, and she'd called for Jalila specifically. Not Jamil, not Farid, not any of the other family members who lived closer or visited more often. Just Jalila, the strange one, the walker-between-worlds.

"She says she has something to give you," Farid told his aunt. "She won't say what. Just keeps asking for you."

Jalila followed her nephew through Baghdad's winding streets to the house where Grandmother Miriam—actually great-aunt, but called grandmother by courtesy—lay on a pallet, ninety-three years old and translucent with age. The room smelled of decay and rosewater, that particular combination that announced approaching death.

The old woman's eyes opened when Jalila entered, and clarity sparked in them.

"You," Miriam whispered. "The one who sees. Good. Close the door. This is for you alone."

Jalila sat beside the pallet, taking the papery hand in hers. Outside the room, she could feel Farid's curiosity, but he respected the dismissal and stayed beyond the door.

"I'm the last," Miriam said. "The last one who remembers the old stories directly from those who lived them. After me, it's all secondhand. Diluted." She coughed, and Jalila helped her drink water. "That's why I called you. You have the gift. You'll carry what I give you properly."

"What are you giving me, grandmother?"

"Knowledge. And an object." Miriam's free hand fumbled beneath her pillow, withdrawing something wrapped in faded silk. "My grandmother gave this to me seventy years ago. Said it was from Isfahan, from before the conversion. Before we were Muslim. When we were Jews. Or before that, when we were fire worshipers. She wasn't sure anymore. But she said: keep it hidden, pass it to someone who'll understand its importance. You understand, don't you?"

"I try to."

"You more than try. You walk through time. I've heard the stories—you sleepwalk to Isfahan, you speak with the dead, you read the carpet like it's a book. All true?"

"True enough."

Miriam unwrapped the silk. Inside was a small bronze disc, perhaps the size of a large coin, green with age. Engraved on its surface: a flame, stylized and eternal, the symbol of Zoroastrianism. The fire that was never supposed to go out.

"This came from the fire temple," Miriam said. "From the original Maktabian family temple, before Maktab converted. It's sacred. Or it was. I don't even know if it still holds power, or if power is real, or if I'm just a dying old woman passing on junk. But your grandmother Leah ate the pomegranate seeds and saw everything. She said the family was Zoroastrian first. This connects to that. You should have it."

Jalila took the disc, feeling its weight. The moment her fingers touched it, she felt something—not quite vision, not quite sound. A vibration, like the echo of chanted prayers from a thousand years ago.

"What am I supposed to do with it?" she asked.

"Add it to the carpet. Weave it in. That carpet holds our history, all the different faiths we've been. But it's missing the beginning. The fire. This is the fire. It belongs there, at the heart, with everything else."

"I don't know how to weave."

"Learn. Or find a way. You walk through time—walk back to when your great-great-great-grandmother was weaving it. Watch her. She'll teach you." Miriam coughed again, more wetly this time. "There's something else. A prophecy. My grandmother told me, made me memorize it. She said someday someone would need to hear it. I think that someone is you."

Jalila leaned closer, listening.

"The family split in Isfahan," Miriam recited, her voice taking on the rhythm of something long-memorized. "One branch went to Islam, one stayed Jewish, one disappeared entirely. The Muslim branch came to Baghdad—that's us. The Jewish branch stayed in Persia, hiding, practicing in secret. The disappeared branch... no one knows. But the prophecy says: the family split. Someday, it will reunite. The carpet will know when. The carpet will call the scattered branches home."

"Where are they? The other branches?"

"I don't know. Maybe dead. Maybe assimilated. Maybe still out there, keeping the faith our ancestors abandoned. But you're leaving—you and Jamil, walking west. Maybe you're the beginning of the reunion. Maybe your descendants will find the lost branches. Maybe the whole thing is fantasy, and I'm wasting your time with an old woman's delusions."

"It's not delusion," Jalila said quietly. "I've seen the pattern too. The family breaks and reforms, breaks and reforms. That's what we do. Maybe someday we'll reform completely."

Miriam smiled. "Good. Then I can die knowing I passed it on. The disc, the prophecy, the knowledge that we're more than we think we are." She squeezed Jalila's hand. "Be safe on your journey, child. I wish I could see where you end up."

"I'll die on the way," Jalila said matter-of-factly. "In the desert. Fever. But my brother will make it, and his son, and the family will continue. That's what matters."

"You're not frightened?"

"No. Death is just another threshold. I've crossed so many already."

Miriam died that afternoon, peacefully, having given away her final secret. At the funeral, Jalila held the bronze disc in her pocket, feeling its weight, understanding that she'd been given both treasure and responsibility.

---

For weeks, Jalila studied the disc and the carpet, trying to understand how to integrate them. She'd never learned weaving—it wasn't her skill, wasn't her path. But the more she handled the disc, the more clearly she heard the instruction: add it to the carpet. Complete the circle. Fire to Torah to Quran to... what came next? That was for future generations to discover. But this piece of the past needed to be incorporated.

One night, she dreamed of Shirin.

The first weaver appeared to her clearly, more solid than most dream-figures, sitting at a loom that existed simultaneously in Isfahan four centuries ago and in Jalila's sleeping mind.

"You need to add it," Shirin said, her voice carrying that matter-of-fact quality that people with real magic always had. No drama, no mystery. Just: this is what needs to happen.

"I don't know how."

"I'll teach you. But not here. You need to come to me. Come to Isfahan. Walk through time the way you've been walking through dreams. Come see the temple, touch the original fire. Then you'll understand how to add its symbol to the carpet."

"Will I survive the journey? I'm sixty-seven years old."

"You won't walk with your body. You'll walk with your spirit. Your body will stay in Baghdad, sleeping. But you'll be gone for days. Your brother needs to watch over you, keep you safe while you're away."

When Jalila woke, she knew what she had to do. She went to Jamil's house, carrying the carpet and the disc.

"I need your help," she told her twin. "I'm going to Isfahan. Not physically—I'll still be here. But I'll be... elsewhere. For two, maybe three days. I need you to stay with my body, make sure I don't hurt myself in the trance, bring me back if it seems I won't return on my own."

Jamil had learned not to question these things. "When?"

"Tonight. I'll enter the trance at sunset, see how far I can walk by morning."

---

The walk was unlike anything Jalila had experienced before, and she'd experienced considerable strangeness in her six decades of life.

She sat beside the unrolled carpet in her courtyard, the bronze disc in her left hand, and let her consciousness loosen from her body. She'd done this hundreds of times in sleepwalking trances, but never so deliberately, never so deeply.

The world tilted. Baghdad dissolved. And she stood on a road she recognized from visions: the road from Baghdad to Isfahan, but not as it currently existed. This was the road from centuries ago, before the recent wars, before Ottoman rule, when Persia was Persia and trade moved freely along well-maintained paths.

She walked. Not with feet—she had no body here, or only a ghost of one—but with intention. Time compressed. The sun rose and set and rose again in minutes. She passed caravans that didn't see her, cities that existed and didn't exist, landscapes that overlapped with multiple eras.

And then Isfahan rose before her, and she knew it instantly. The city of her family's origin, beautiful and complicated, with its mosques and bazaars and gardens. But she wasn't seeing the Isfahan of her time. She was seeing multiple Isfahans, layered over each other: the Zoroastrian city, the Jewish quarter, the forced conversion era, the decline and revival and decline again.

She walked to where the Jewish quarter had been. Found the house where Maktab and Shirin had lived, though it was ruins in some time periods and thriving in others. The building flickered between states as she approached.

And there, in the courtyard, visible in the version of time when the house was whole: Shirin, sitting at her loom, weaving the carpet that Jalila now carried four centuries into the future.

"You came," Shirin said, not looking up from her work. "I've been waiting."

"You've been dead for three hundred years."

"Time isn't linear, child. I'm weaving this carpet right now, in my present. You're carrying it in yours. But this moment—this meeting—exists in the space between. We're both here, both real, talking across centuries because the carpet makes it possible."

Jalila approached, watching Shirin's hands move with impossible speed and certainty. "How do I add the disc? How do I weave it in without destroying your work?"

"I'll show you. But first, you need to understand what you're adding. Come."

Shirin stood, and the courtyard dissolved. They walked—or flew, or teleported, distinctions didn't matter—to the fire temple. It was magnificent, ancient, its sacred fire burning in the center with a light that hurt to look at directly.

"This is where we came from," Shirin said. "Before Judaism, before Islam, before all the transformations. This fire. This eternal light. Maktab's father tended this flame. When Maktab converted, he thought he was abandoning the fire. But he wasn't. He was carrying it forward in different form."

"The disc came from here."

"Yes. It was blessed by the fire, consecrated by priests who kept the flame alive for centuries. It holds that power still. When you add it to the carpet, you're not adding a relic. You're adding the fire itself. The original light that started everything."

Shirin led her back to the courtyard, to the loom. "Now watch. I'll show you the technique, and you'll remember it when you wake. You won't have a loom—you can't replicate my weaving exactly. But you can add the disc to the carpet's edge, binding it in with new thread. The carpet will accept it because the carpet knows: this is the missing piece. The beginning that was lost is being restored."

Jalila watched as Shirin demonstrated a complex pattern of knotting, showing how to wrap the disc so it became part of the weaving without damaging existing threads. It was delicate work, requiring patience and precision, but not impossible.

"I can do this," Jalila murmured.

"I know. That's why I'm showing you. You're the only one in your generation who can walk between times, who can learn from the past directly. You're the bridge, Jalila. Not just for your family, but for the carpet itself."

"I die on the journey to Beirut."

"I know. I wove your death into the pattern when I made the carpet. I saw you: dying in the desert, your brother weeping, but your spirit continuing. You'll guide them as ghost. It's not the ending you wanted, but it's the ending the family needs."

"I'm not afraid."

"I know that too. Fear would make you weak, and you need to be strong. Your death is sacrifice, but it's also transformation. You'll become what I am—a presence in the carpet, a voice that speaks across generations. We'll be companions, you and I. Won't that be pleasant?"

Jalila smiled despite the strangeness of the moment. "I think it will."

"Then learn what I'm teaching, carry the disc back to your time, add it to the carpet properly. Complete the circle. Fire to present, past to future, all woven together."

The vision began to fade. Isfahan dissolved, Shirin's face blurred, and Jalila felt herself being pulled back across centuries, across miles, into her body that sat in a Baghdad courtyard.

She woke gasping, and Jamil was there with water.

"Three days," he said. "You've been gone three days. I kept you breathing, kept you safe. Where were you?"

"Isfahan. With Shirin. Learning." Jalila's hands shook as she took the water, drank. "I know how to add the disc now. Help me."

---

It took a week to do properly. Jalila acquired thread—wool dyed to match the carpet's colors as closely as possible. She studied the edge where she planned to add the disc, memorizing the existing patterns so she wouldn't disrupt them. And then, carefully, meticulously, she began to weave.

The work was slow. She'd never woven before, and her sixty-seven-year-old hands weren't as steady as they'd once been. But she followed Shirin's instructions exactly, wrapping the disc in new thread, binding it into the carpet's border with knots that pulled tight without damaging the old weaving.

As she worked, she entered a state similar to the trance she'd experienced in Isfahan. Not as deep, but enough that time became fluid. She lost hours without noticing, working by lamplight that seemed to burn without oil depleting.

And the carpet responded. She felt it—the whole weaving coming alive under her hands, recognizing what she was adding, accepting it as belonging. The disc settled into its place as if it had always been there, and the patterns around it shifted subtly, incorporating the new element into the larger design.

When she tied the final knot, Jalila felt a pulse run through the entire carpet, like a heartbeat, like recognition.

"It's complete now," she whispered. "Fire and Torah and Quran and all the faiths in between. All of us, woven together."

Jamil, who'd been watching from the doorway, approached slowly. "It looks different. The colors around where you added the disc—they're brighter."

"The carpet is pleased. We gave it back something it was missing."

That night, Jalila slept beside the carpet, and in her dreams, she met all of them: Shirin and Maktab, Yousef and Esther, Hassan the drunk and Leah who'd eaten the seeds, all the ancestors whose stories lived in the patterns. They welcomed her into their company, telling her she'd done well, that the family would continue because of her work.

And in the dream, they showed her the future—not hers, but the family's. She saw Beirut, saw the shop window where the carpet would hang, saw her great-great-niece Sahar touching the patterns and understanding everything. Saw the carpet speaking to that distant descendant with the same clarity it had spoken to her.

The thread was strong. Frayed in places, stretched thin, but unbroken. And her work—adding the disc, accepting her coming death, preparing her brother for the journey—all of it served that thread's continuity.

---

Two days before the family was scheduled to leave Baghdad, Jalila called Jamil to her rooms one final time.

"I want you to know something," she said. "We've lived our entire lives together. Shared a womb, grew up side by side, stayed close even when we lived separately. I've loved you every moment of that time."

"I know. I love you too."

"When I die on the journey—and I will die, don't pretend otherwise—I need you to not stop. Don't spend days mourning me. Wrap my body, bury me quickly, and keep moving. The carpet will guide you, and I'll be there anyway, just in different form. Promise me you won't let grief paralyze you."

"How am I supposed to promise that? You're my twin. My other half."

"And I'll still be your other half. Just one you can't see. That's all death is, Jamil. A thinning of the veil, not its destruction. I'll walk beside you from Baghdad to Beirut and beyond. You'll feel me in the moments when you need to make hard choices. You'll hear me when the carpet seems unclear. I won't abandon you. I'll just be elsewhere."

Jamil was crying, which he almost never did. "I don't want this."

"I know. Neither do I, really. I'd prefer to reach Beirut, to see Farid's children grow up, to know the end of the story. But that's not my path. My path is to get you there and then become what the family needs—a guide who's already crossed the threshold, who can speak from the other side."

They sat together in silence, holding hands the way they had as children, as young adults, as old people preparing for a journey that would separate them finally and forever—at least in the way that mattered to bodies, if not to souls.

"Thank you," Jamil said finally. "For all of it. For seeing what I couldn't see, for believing when I doubted, for carrying the family's magic when I was too practical to touch it."

"You're exactly who you needed to be. The skeptic who still followed. That's as important as the believer who leaps. We balance each other. We always have."

"Will I see you? After you die?"

"I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. But you'll feel me. That's enough."

On the morning they left Baghdad, Jalila rolled up the carpet herself, wrapping it carefully, tying it secure. The bronze disc was now part of it, woven invisibly into the edge, holding the fire that had started everything. Past and present bound together, ready for the future.

She touched the patterns one last time, whispering goodbye to Shirin and all the ancestors who lived there. They whispered back, blessing her journey, promising to catch her when she fell, to hold her when transformation came.

And then she shouldered her pack—too heavy for a woman her age, but she'd managed impossible things before—and walked out the door of the house where she'd lived her entire life, never looking back.

Because Maktabians didn't look back. They looked forward, toward the sea, toward transformation, toward the stubborn continuation that was their only real inheritance.

The carpet knew where they were going.

And now, so did Jalila's ghost, waiting to be born.
