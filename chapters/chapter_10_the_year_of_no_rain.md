## The Drought

The Tigris was low enough to walk across in places. Jamil Maktabian stood on the riverbank in the August heat, looking at sandbars that shouldn't exist, at fishing boats beached and useless, at the exposed foundations of ancient buildings that had been submerged for centuries.

1873, and Baghdad was dying of thirst.

It hadn't rained properly in fourteen months. The crops had failed two seasons running. The date palms that lined the river were withering, their fronds brown and curled. In the souqs, bread cost four times what it should, and water—water, in a city built on a river—was being rationed.

Jamil was fifty-three years old, his beard gone completely gray, his body still strong from decades of carpet repair work. He'd married, had a son—Farid, now twenty-eight with a young family of his own—and built a modest but stable life. Nothing prosperous, but reliable. Until the drought.

"Father." Farid approached, carrying an empty water jug. "The well in our courtyard is dry. The neighbor says his has been dry for a week."

"Take this." Jamil handed him a few coins. "Buy from the water sellers. Boil it first—with the river this low, everything's contaminated."

After Farid left, Jamil stayed by the river, watching what remained of it flow sluggishly toward the south. Other men gathered in similar vigils, as if their presence could coax the water higher. An old Kurdish man Jamil knew slightly came to stand beside him.

"I heard the mullahs saying it's God's judgment," the man said. "Punishment for our sins."

"God judges with specificity, or everyone equally," Jamil replied. "This drought doesn't distinguish between the righteous and the wicked. It's just weather."

"Your sister would disagree. Jalila says everything means something."

Jamil sighed. His twin sister, now living a few streets away in her own modest rooms, had become known in the neighborhood as a seer. People came to her with questions about futures, about missing relatives, about whether to make journeys or investments. She gave answers that were disturbingly accurate, and she refused payment, which made her either holy or mad depending on who you asked.

"My sister sees patterns the rest of us don't," Jamil said carefully. "But that doesn't mean the drought is prophetic. Sometimes disasters are just disasters."

"She told Wasim the baker not to travel to Basra last month. He went anyway. Died of fever two weeks later."

"Coincidence."

"Your sister makes a lot of convincing coincidences."

After the man left, Jamil walked to Jalila's rooms. She lived alone—had never married, despite being handsome and capable. She'd said once that marriage would interfere with her work, by which she meant her dreaming, her sleepwalking, her conversations with people who'd been dead for centuries.

He found her in her courtyard, sitting beside the carpet they'd inherited from their grandmother. It was unrolled on the ground, and Jalila's hands moved over its surface, not touching it but hovering just above, as if reading invisible text.

"The drought is in the pattern," she said without looking up. "I can see it. This year, next year. Then the rains return. But by then, half the city will have left or died."

"Jalila." Jamil sat down heavily beside her. "We need to talk practically. Farid has three children now. His wife is pregnant again. They're barely eating. Should we leave? Should we take the family and go while we still have the strength?"

"No. Not yet. This is preparation, not departure. We're being tested. Can we wait through suffering? Can we hold onto hope when everything says it's foolish?"

"That's not an answer. That's mysticism."

She finally looked at him, and her eyes had that distant quality that frightened him. His twin sister, whom he'd shared a womb with, whom he knew better than anyone in the world, and sometimes she looked at him like she was seeing through him to something beyond.

"We leave in autumn, 1901," she said calmly. "Twenty-eight years from now. Not before. The carpet is very clear about this. If we go earlier, we fail. If we go later, we miss the window. Autumn, 1901. Mark it, remember it, trust it."

"Twenty-eight years? Jalila, we'll be over eighty. We can't make that journey as old people."

"We'll be seventy-eight. And yes, we can. We'll have to."

Jamil wanted to argue, but he'd learned decades ago that arguing with his sister when she was in this state was pointless. She saw what she saw, and usually, she was right. He'd doubted her too many times and been proven wrong. Now he just accepted her pronouncements and tried to plan around them.

"What do we do until then?" he asked. "How do we survive?"

"We do what Maktabians do. We endure. We adapt. We hold onto the carpet and remember who we are."

"The carpet won't feed anyone."

"Won't it?" She touched the patterns lightly. "It's kept us alive for four hundred years. It will keep us alive another twenty-eight."

## The Visions Intensify

Jalila's abilities had been growing stronger throughout her life, but in the drought years, they became overwhelming. She dreamed every night—not normal dreams but prophetic ones, detailed and specific. She saw the exact route they would take from Baghdad to the Mediterranean. Saw the caravan they would join, the stops they would make, the dangers they would face.

And she saw her death.

It came to her in fragments at first, then with increasing clarity. She would die of fever somewhere in the Syrian desert, three months into the journey. Would be buried quickly, wrapped in cloth they couldn't spare, in a grave that would be lost within a year to shifting sand. Jamil would weep over her body—she saw his face, aged and devastated—and then would continue forward because stopping would mean failing, and failing would mean breaking the promise.

The vision didn't frighten her. Death was just transformation, another threshold to cross. What frightened her was the possibility that she'd miscalculated the timing, that they'd leave too early or too late, that the family would arrive in Beirut but be unable to establish themselves, dying as refugees instead of survivors.

She spent her days checking and rechecking the carpet's patterns, looking for confirmation. The carpet had become more active than it had been in generations. Each morning, she would find the patterns subtly different—a figure moved from one position to another, a line curved differently, colors intensifying or fading based on what the future held.

"It's recalculating," she explained to Jamil one evening when he came to check on her. "As history changes, as people make choices, the possible futures shift. The carpet adjusts its patterns to show the most likely path. Right now, it's saying: autumn 1901, leave from the northern gate, join the caravan of Mahmoud the merchant, carry these specific supplies, and the probability of success is seventy percent."

"Seventy percent isn't certainty."

"No. But it's the best odds we'll get. The other paths show failure rates above fifty percent. This is our window."

Jamil looked at the carpet—this artifact that had haunted his family for centuries, that his grandmother Leah had eaten pomegranate seeds to understand, that his grandfather Hassan had drunk himself to death trying to hear. He still wasn't sure he believed in its magic, not really. But he couldn't deny the patterns seemed to change, and his sister seemed to read them with impossible accuracy.

"What if you're wrong?" he asked quietly. "What if we leave everything, drag our children and grandchildren across a desert, and arrive at this seaside city to find nothing? No opportunity, no help, no future. Just more poverty in a different place."

"Then we'll have tried. And trying is better than waiting here to die slowly."

"Is it?"

"Yes." She looked at him with absolute conviction. "Because the carpet says we succeed. Not easily, not without loss. But we arrive, we establish ourselves, we continue. I've seen it, Jamil. I've walked through that future. Farid's children will speak Arabic with a Lebanese accent. They'll eat sea fish and mountain vegetables we've never tasted. They'll forget Persian almost completely. But they'll keep the carpet, and it will keep them, and the thread won't break."

Jamil sat in silence, feeling the weight of his sister's certainty. Finally: "You're sure you die on the journey?"

"Yes."

"Can we change it? If we know, can we avoid it?"

"No. I've looked for alternate paths. In every version where we succeed, I die. It's the price. One of us has to pay for passage, and it's me. You're the one who has to arrive, who has to help Farid establish the family. I'm the guide who gets them to the threshold but doesn't cross."

"That's not fair."

"Since when is anything fair?" But she smiled slightly. "Don't mourn me too much, brother. I'll still help you. I've been practicing walking between worlds. After I die, I'll walk beside you as ghost. You probably won't see me, but Farid's wife might—she has the gift too, I've seen it in her eyes. And their daughter Sahar definitely will. I'll be there. Just in different form."

Jamil didn't know what to say to that. His twin sister, calmly discussing her death and posthumous career as a family ghost, as if this were normal. As if any of this were normal.

But then, for their family, maybe it was.

## The Waiting

The drought broke in 1874, but it changed Baghdad permanently. A third of the city had died or left. The survivors were harder, meaner, more suspicious. The economy took decades to recover. Jamil's carpet repair business barely survived, and only because he'd diversified, taking any work he could find—dock loading, caravan guarding, scribing for illiterate merchants.

Farid grew into middle age, his own children growing up in the shadow of coming departure. Jamil told them the plan—leave in 1901, move to Beirut—and they thought he was mad. But Jalila's reputation as a seer gave the plan credibility. If strange Aunt Jalila said it was time to go, perhaps they should listen.

The decades passed with agonizing slowness. Jamil and Jalila aged. By 1890, they were both sixty-seven, their bodies starting to fail in small ways. Jalila's sleepwalking became more frequent and more distant—neighbors found her miles from home, wandering in trances, speaking to people who weren't there.

Once, she walked all the way to Isfahan—two hundred miles, impossible for a woman in her sixties, but she did it in three days. When Jamil finally found her, she was standing in the ruins of the old Jewish quarter, looking at buildings that had been torn down two centuries ago.

"I was visiting," she said calmly. "Shirin wanted to show me where she'd woven the carpet. The loom was right there." She pointed to empty space. "I could see it. And her, teaching me how to read the deeper patterns."

Jamil brought her home, and she slept for two days straight. When she woke, she had new knowledge—could read sections of the carpet she'd been unable to decipher before.

"I know the full route now," she said. "Every stop, every danger. And I know what we need to survive."

She made lists. Specific supplies, specific amounts. Money they needed to save, connections they needed to make, skills they needed to learn. Jamil followed her instructions with the faith of someone who'd given up arguing. He saved copper fils in a buried jar. He learned desert travel from Bedouin traders. He taught Farid everything he knew about carpet repair, ensuring the skill would continue.

And he watched the carpet, which did indeed seem to change. Sometimes he could swear figures in the patterns moved. Sometimes he dreamed of routes through desert, of blue water, of white buildings climbing hillsides, and he'd wake certain the dreams came from outside himself.

"I still don't know if I believe," he told Jalila one evening in 1900, a year before their departure. They were seventy-seven now, old and tired but still upright.

"You don't have to believe. You just have to come with me."

"I will. I promised grandmother Leah, and I keep my promises. But Jalila—what if we get there and it's all wrong? What if this has been madness all along?"

"Then we'll die having tried something impossible. That's better than dying having tried nothing."

"Is it?"

"For Maktabians, yes. We don't do safe. We do stubborn."

## The Sign

Autumn, 1900. Jalila woke Jamil in the middle of the night, shaking his shoulder urgently.

"It's time. Look."

She'd unrolled the carpet in their courtyard, and in the moonlight, it was glowing. Not brightly—nothing dramatic—but with a soft, insistent luminescence that came from within the threads themselves.

"It's never done that before," Jamil whispered.

"It's confirming. Saying yes, now, this is the moment. We have exactly one year to prepare. Next autumn, we leave."

The glow faded as they watched, the carpet returning to its normal appearance. But something had changed. Jamil felt it—a certainty settling into his bones, a knowledge that the time had indeed come.

"I'll tell Farid in the morning," he said.

"Tell him to believe me. Tell him the carpet spoke, and this is really happening."

In the morning, Jamil gathered his son, daughter-in-law Rania, and their four children—Nabil (eleven), Sahar (eight), and Khalil (five). He unrolled the carpet in front of them and told them everything.

"Your great-great-grandmother Shirin wove this carpet four centuries ago in Isfahan. She put prophecy into its patterns. Your grandmother Leah ate pomegranate seeds from a magic tree and saw our entire history. Your aunt Jalila has been dreaming our route for decades. And now the carpet says: it's time. One year from now, we leave Baghdad. We walk to Beirut. We start over."

"That's insane," Nabil said. "We have a life here. I'm in school. Father has work. We can't just leave."

"We can and we will," Jamil said with a firmness that surprised himself. "Because this family survives by moving. We've been in Baghdad for two centuries, and it's been slow decline the whole time. If we stay, we fade away completely. If we go, we have a chance."

Rania, who'd been quiet, spoke up. "I've seen them."

Everyone turned to her.

"The dead," she continued. "I've always seen them. Ghosts in the market, spirits in our courtyard. I thought I was mad, but my mother said it was a gift. Last night, I saw a woman with green eyes standing beside the carpet. She smiled at me. And I knew—she's been waiting for us to be ready. We're ready now."

Farid looked between his wife, his father, his aunt, all of them certain of this impossible thing. Then he looked at his children. Nabil skeptical and frightened. Sahar wide-eyed and curious. Little Khalil who'd been sickly since birth, who might not survive a desert journey.

"If we do this," Farid said slowly, "we commit completely. We sell everything, we spend everything, we burn our bridges. If it fails, we die as refugees. Are you all certain?"

"Yes," said Jalila.

"Yes," said Jamil.

"Yes," said Rania.

The children said nothing, but they didn't need to. The decision had been made by adults, by ancestors, by magic woven into patterns four hundred years ago.

They had one year to prepare. And then they would walk west into prophecy, into danger, into a future the carpet promised but couldn't guarantee.

The year of no rain had tested whether they could endure. Now came the test of whether they could move.

And the Maktabians, stubborn as ever, would answer: yes.

Always yes.

Because stopping meant disappearing, and disappearing was the only thing they'd never learned to do.
