## Building a Life

Three years after arriving in Beirut with nothing, the Maktabians had built something that looked almost like prosperity.

The shop occupied a good corner in the textile district, with large windows that let in Mediterranean light. Farid had learned to arrange the displays so the best pieces caught the sun—Persian carpets in jewel tones, Syrian textiles in geometric patterns, Lebanese silk in colors that seemed to breathe. And in the center window, always: the family carpet, four hundred years old, drawing customers who couldn't explain why they felt compelled to enter.

Rania managed the household above the shop with the same efficiency she'd managed a single room in Baghdad. Three children, a husband, and now that they could afford it, proper meals three times a day. The transformation from poverty to stability had happened so quickly it still felt unreal—as if they might wake up back in Baghdad, starving, the whole thing a fever dream.

"Sometimes I have to touch the walls," she told Farid one evening. "Just to make sure they're solid. That this is real."

"It's real. We earned it. Walked across a desert for it."

"Yousef gave it to us."

"Yousef gave us the opportunity. We're the ones making it work."

The children had transformed too. Nabil, now fourteen, had shed the half-starved intensity of his Baghdad years and grown into a confident young man. He'd enrolled in a French school, learned the language quickly, and now spoke it better than Arabic. He helped in the shop after school, charming French customers, understanding instinctively how to read what people wanted.

Sahar at eleven was harder to categorize. She'd always been serious, but in Beirut that seriousness had deepened into something else. She spent hours staring at the family carpet, tracing patterns with her fingers, asking questions no one else thought to ask. Where did grandmother Shirin learn to weave? Could the patterns predict futures or only record pasts? Why did the colors seem different depending on who looked at them?

And Khalil—eight years old, still fragile despite the pomegranate seeds that had saved him in the desert—had started writing. Poetry at first, childish verses about birds and the sea. But gradually his poems had grown stranger, more mature, touching on themes no eight-year-old should understand: exile, transformation, the weight of inherited memory.

"He's gifted," Farid said, reading one of Khalil's recent poems. "Genuinely gifted. This line—'we are the ones who carry fire in languages the fire doesn't speak'—that's remarkable."

"It's also disturbing," Rania replied. "An eight-year-old shouldn't write about carrying fire. Shouldn't know about the family's Zoroastrian past. I haven't taught him those stories yet."

"Maybe the carpet taught him."

"That's what worries me."

## Sahar Discovers Her Gift

It happened on a Tuesday afternoon, when Sahar was alone in the shop. Her father had gone to the port to meet a supplier, her mother was at the market, Nabil was at school, and Khalil was sleeping upstairs, recovering from another of his frequent fevers.

Sahar was supposed to be sweeping, but instead she found herself standing in front of the family carpet, looking at it properly for the first time in weeks. The shop had been too busy for contemplation. But now, in the quiet, she could really see.

The patterns moved.

Not dramatically. Not like they were alive. But subtly, like heat shimmer, like water reflecting light. Figures in the weaving seemed to shift positions. Colors brightened and dimmed. Text she'd never noticed before appeared in the borders.

Sahar reached out to touch a particular section—a spiral pattern near the center—and the world inverted.

She was falling, or flying, or both. The shop disappeared. She stood in a different place: Isfahan, but not Isfahan as it existed now. This was Isfahan centuries ago, when it had been the jewel of Safavid Persia. She saw a house, a courtyard, a woman sitting at a loom.

The woman had green eyes. Sahar's eyes.

"Hello, child," the woman said without looking up from her weaving. "You're early. I didn't expect you for another few years."

"Who are you?"

"You know who I am. You have my eyes, my hands, my gift. I'm Shirin. I wove this carpet you're touching. And I wove you into it, four hundred years before you were born."

"This is a dream."

"No. This is the carpet's true space. The place between threads, where past and future exist simultaneously. You've entered it because you have the gift. The ability to read patterns, to see across time, to speak with ancestors. Jalila had it. Your mother has a weaker version. Now you have it, stronger than anyone since me."

"I don't want it."

Shirin laughed, a sound like water over stones. "Most keepers don't, at first. It's frightening, being able to see things others can't. But Sahar—and yes, I know your name, I wove it into the pattern—you don't have a choice. The gift chose you. You can refuse to use it, but that will only make you miserable. Better to accept, to learn, to become what you're meant to be."

"What am I meant to be?"

"The next keeper. The one who remembers when others forget. The bridge between your generation and all the ones who came before. You'll study this carpet your whole life. You'll learn to walk its patterns as I'm teaching you now. And you'll pass that knowledge to your daughter, who'll pass it to hers. That's your purpose."

"What if I want a normal life? Husband, children, ordinary happiness?"

"You can have those too. I did. Had a husband I loved, children I raised, an ordinary life in many ways. The gift doesn't exclude normalcy. It just adds another layer. You'll live in two worlds—the ordinary one where you sell carpets and raise children, and the magical one where you speak with the dead and see the future. Both are real. Both matter."

The vision began to fade, Isfahan dissolving back into the Beirut shop. Shirin's voice followed Sahar back across the centuries: "Practice. Touch the carpet every day. Learn to enter at will. I'll teach you, and so will the others. We're all here, waiting to guide you. Welcome to the family, keeper."

Sahar gasped as she returned fully to her body. She was lying on the floor of the shop, the family carpet beneath her, her hands still touching the spiral pattern. The sun had moved—she'd been gone for hours, though it had felt like minutes.

The door opened. Her mother entered, carrying market baskets, and stopped when she saw Sahar on the floor.

"You went inside," Rania said. Not a question. "I can see it in your eyes. You saw them."

"Shirin. The first weaver. She spoke to me."

"Good. It's time. You're eleven—Jalila was twelve when it started for her. The gift awakens in adolescence." Rania set down the baskets, knelt beside her daughter. "How do you feel?"

"Scared. Excited. Confused. All of it."

"That's normal. Come. We need to talk about what this means, how to control it, how to use it without letting it consume you."

They spent the afternoon together, mother teaching daughter, as Rania's mother had taught her, as generations of Maktabian women had taught their gifted children. How to enter the carpet deliberately instead of being pulled in accidentally. How to protect your mind while walking through time. How to distinguish between true visions and imagination. How to return safely to the present.

"The gift is powerful," Rania explained, "but it's also dangerous. Jalila let it take over her life, couldn't stay grounded in the present. You need to be stronger than that. Use the gift, but don't let it use you. You're Sahar first, keeper second. Remember that."

"Will it hurt? The visions?"

"Sometimes. You'll see things you don't want to see—deaths, disasters, the family's suffering. But you'll also see beautiful things. Births, reunions, moments of joy. The pattern contains everything. You just have to learn not to be overwhelmed by the everything."

That night, Sahar lay in bed unable to sleep, feeling the carpet's presence two rooms away. Feeling all the ancestors watching from inside its patterns, waiting for her to be ready. She'd wanted to be normal, to be just a girl in Beirut with an ordinary future. But the carpet had other plans.

And deep down, beneath the fear, she felt something else: excitement. She'd been chosen. Out of all her generation, she was the one who could see. That had to mean something.

She'd learn to read the patterns. Learn to walk through time. Learn to be the keeper.

Because that's what Maktabians did. They accepted impossible gifts and made them work.

## Khalil's Poems

Khalil's poetry had started as a curiosity, then become concerning, and finally had evolved into something his family couldn't quite categorize.

At eight years old, he was writing verse that adults found moving and disturbing in equal measure. His poems appeared without warning—he'd be playing with toy soldiers, then suddenly grab paper and scribble furiously for twenty minutes, emerging with completed work that needed no revision.

"Where do the words come from?" Farid asked him once.

"The people in the carpet," Khalil answered matter-of-factly. "They tell me stories, and I write them down. Sometimes in Arabic, sometimes in Persian, sometimes in languages I don't know but that sound right."

"The people in the carpet."

"Yes. Grandfather Jamil visits most often. And Great-Aunt Jalila. And sometimes a woman with green eyes who says she's the first weaver. They all have things they want said, so I say them."

Rania heard this conversation and intervened. "Khalil, habibi, come with me."

She took her youngest son to where the carpet hung, unrolled a section on the floor, and had him sit beside it.

"Touch it," she instructed. "Tell me what you feel."

Khalil placed his small hand on the weaving and closed his eyes. For a long moment, nothing. Then: "They're here. All of them. Watching us. They've always been watching. They're so happy we made it to Beirut. They were worried we'd die in Baghdad, but we didn't, and now they can rest easier."

"Can you see them?"

"Not see, exactly. But I hear them. Their voices overlap, like many people talking at once, but I can separate the voices if I concentrate. Grandfather Jamil has a deep voice, very patient. Jalila sounds like wind through grass. The first weaver sounds like water."

"And they tell you what to write?"

"They don't tell me, exactly. They just... are. And when I'm near the carpet, their being-ness fills me up, and I have to put it into words or I'll burst. So I write poems. It's the only way to let it out."

Rania looked at her son—fragile, brilliant, already marked by something larger than childhood—and felt the familiar Maktabian mix of pride and sorrow. Another generation, another gifted child, another keeper in training.

"You're like your sister," she told him. "You have the gift. Yours is different from Sahar's—she sees, you hear. She walks through time, you translate what the ancestors say into words. But it's the same inheritance, two different expressions."

"Will I die young?"

The question was so direct, so calm, that Rania was momentarily speechless.

"They've told you," she said finally.

"Yes. In the war that's coming. I'll be twenty-one. It doesn't frighten me. I've known my whole life, since the desert when the pomegranate seeds saved me. They didn't save me forever. Just long enough to finish my work."

"What work?"

"Writing it all down. The family's story in verse. So people who can't read carpets can still understand who we are. That's my purpose. I have thirteen more years to complete it."

Rania held her son, this child who spoke of his own death with the acceptance of someone three times his age, and wept. Not for him—he didn't need tears—but for herself, for the knowledge she'd carry for thirteen years, watching him grow and create and prepare to become an ancestor.

## The First Loss

Grandfather Jamil died in his sleep in the autumn of 1905, a year after they'd established themselves in Beirut. He was eighty-two years old, ancient by any standard, and he'd held on just long enough to see the family safe.

The funeral was large—the Maktabians had made connections in Beirut's merchant community, and people came to pay respects. Muslim prayers, because that's what Jamil had been raised, though Rania suspected his private faith had been a confused mix of everything the family had ever been.

Sahar saw his ghost immediately. He stood beside his own grave, looking younger already, the burden of decades falling away.

"You can see me," he said when Sahar made eye contact.

"Yes. So can Mother."

"Good. Tell the family I'm fine. Better than fine. I'm with Jalila again—my twin, my other half. We've been reunited, and it's like being whole for the first time since the desert. Tell them not to grieve too much. Death is just crossing a threshold, and I've crossed so many already."

"Where are you going now?"

"Into the carpet. To join the others. I'll watch over you, help when I can, be present in the patterns. Your children's children will know me through the weaving, will feel me guiding them. That's not death. That's transformation."

He began to fade, becoming translucent, becoming light. "One more thing, great-granddaughter. You're the keeper now. Fully. No more apprenticeship. The ancestors accept you, the carpet claims you. It's your burden now. Carry it well."

And then he was gone, dissolved into pattern, joining the chorus of ancestral voices.

At the funeral feast afterward, Nabil was unusually quiet. Finally, he spoke: "I don't have the gift. I can't see ghosts or read the carpet or write prophetic poetry. Does that make me less Maktabian?"

"No," Farid said firmly. "Every family needs practical people. Dreamers and seers are important, but so are the ones who keep accounts, who build businesses, who deal with the ordinary world. That's you, Nabil. You're the foundation. Without you, the magic wouldn't matter—you can't eat visions."

"But I feel like I'm missing something. Sahar sees things. Khalil hears things. I just... sell carpets."

"You sell carpets very well," Rania interjected. "And you're learning French better than any of us. And you understand money in ways the rest of us don't. Those are gifts too, habibi. Not magical, but necessary. The family needs both kinds."

Nabil nodded, accepting this, but Sahar saw the hurt in his eyes. He felt excluded from the family's magic, and no amount of reassurance would change that. She made a mental note to include him somehow, to show him that the carpet held spaces for practical people too, that not all importance was magical.

That night, the family gathered around the carpet as they often did, telling stories about Grandfather Jamil. Remembering his skepticism-turned-faith, his steady strength during the journey, his quiet pride in seeing them established.

"We're truly on our own now," Farid said. "The generation that made the journey—Father and Aunt Jalila—they're both gone. We're the ones carrying it forward now."

"Not alone," Sahar corrected. "They're in the carpet. They're always with us. We just have to learn to hear them."

She touched the weaving, and the patterns shifted. And for a moment, everyone—even Nabil—could see them: Jamil and Jalila together, young again, smiling, watching over their descendants with love and approval.

The thread held.

The family continued.

And in a shop in Beirut, surrounded by carpets and silk and the smell of cardamom coffee, the Maktabians told their stories and kept their memories and refused—as always—to disappear.
