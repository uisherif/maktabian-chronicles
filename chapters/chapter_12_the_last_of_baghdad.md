The room measured perhaps twelve feet by fifteen. In it lived seven people: Farid Maktabian, his wife Rania, his elderly father Jamil, his aunt Jalila, and their three surviving children—Nabil (eleven), Sahar (eight), and Khalil (five). The baby they'd lost two years ago wasn't counted, though Rania sometimes set out an extra cup at meals, which Farid pretended not to notice.

Twelve by fifteen. Barely enough space to lie down at night without touching each other. No privacy, no quiet, no escape from the sounds and smells of too many bodies in too little space. This was what the Maktabian family had come to after two hundred years in Baghdad: a single rented room in the poorest quarter, where even the rats looked better fed than the children.

Farid sat in the doorway, watching his father and aunt prepare for their morning ritual. They were seventy-eight years old, both of them, absurdly ancient and absurdly determined. Every morning they unrolled the carpet—their one valuable possession, the family heirloom they'd never been willing to sell—and studied its patterns as if reading scripture.

"See here?" Jamil pointed to a section of weaving. "The blue has darkened. That means timing is confirmed."

"And here," Jalila touched a different area, "the figure has moved closer to the edge. We're almost at departure."

They'd been having these conversations for years, reading the carpet like a map to an impossible future. Farid had learned to tune them out. He had more immediate concerns: his family was starving.

"Father," Farid said quietly, "I was at the docks yesterday. The foreman says there's no work. Too many men desperate for too few jobs. I've gone three weeks without wages."

Jamil didn't look up from the carpet. "We're leaving in three months. You won't need to find work here."

"But I need to feed my family for the next three months. The children are skin and bones. Khalil is sick again—"

"The carpet will provide."

"The carpet is wool and dye. It doesn't provide anything except delusions."

Now Jamil looked up, and his eyes held that particular stubbornness Farid had inherited and hated recognizing in himself. "You think I don't see your suffering? You think I don't know we're destitute? But Farid—son—I've lived seventy-eight years following this carpet's guidance. It's never been wrong. Not once. When it says we leave in autumn, we leave in autumn. When it says we'll survive until then, we'll survive."

"How? On air? On faith?"

"On stubbornness. That's the family gift. We're too stubborn to die."

Farid wanted to argue, wanted to shake his father until sense came back. But Rania emerged from inside the room, carrying Khalil. The boy was burning with fever again, his small body wracked with coughs that sounded like tearing fabric.

"He needs medicine," Rania said. Her voice was calm, but Farid heard the terror underneath. "Real medicine, not prayers."

"We have no money for medicine."

"Then sell the carpet."

The room went silent. Jamil and Jalila both stiffened, and Farid felt the weight of his wife's words hang in the air like an accusation. They'd all thought it—thought it dozens, hundreds of times over the years. But no one had said it so baldly in front of the old ones.

"No," Jamil said simply.

"Your grandson is dying."

"If we sell the carpet, we all die. Maybe not today, but spiritually, we die. That carpet is the only thing connecting us to who we were. Without it, we're just refugees with no history, no future. Nothing."

"I'd rather be alive with nothing than dead with everything."

Rania's voice was sharp enough that even Jalila looked up, startled. Farid's wife was usually so quiet, so diplomatic. But she'd reached her limit.

"Your father and aunt are asking us to trust an impossible thing," Rania continued, addressing Farid but speaking to them all. "To leave Baghdad—the only city we've known for generations—and walk across a desert to some city we've never seen, based on visions and patterns in a rug. Do you understand how insane that sounds?"

"I do," Farid said quietly.

"And you still think we should do it?"

He looked at his son, feverish and small. Looked at Nabil, eleven years old and already trying to be the man of the family, his childhood stolen by poverty. Looked at Sahar, eight and too serious, who spent her time staring at the carpet like she could read it too. Looked at his wife, exhausted and furious and desperate.

And then he looked at the carpet itself, unrolled in the morning light, its patterns intricate and beautiful and seemingly meaningless.

Except.

Farid had seen things too. Not visions, not like his aunt Jalila. But moments. Coincidences that weren't coincidences. Times when the carpet had been in a room and things had gone impossibly right. Times when following its supposed guidance had led to unexpected solutions.

Magic? No. He didn't believe in magic. But pattern recognition? Generations of accumulated wisdom somehow encoded in thread? That, maybe. That he could accept.

"Yes," he said finally. "I think we should go."

Rania stared at him. "You're as mad as they are."

"Maybe. But Rania—what's our alternative? Stay here and watch our children die slowly of malnutrition and disease? At least if we go, we're choosing action. We're trying. And if the carpet is right—if Beirut is really the place where we can start over—then we owe it to our children to try."

"And if the carpet is wrong? If we die in the desert?"

"Then we die trying, which is better than dying slowly in this room."

---

The family council happened that night, after the children were asleep. Jamil and Jalila, Farid and Rania, all of them sitting in a circle around the carpet, speaking in whispers so the children wouldn't wake.

"Tell them," Jamil said to Jalila. "Tell them what you see."

His sister closed her eyes, hands resting on the carpet. When she spoke, her voice had that distant quality that meant she wasn't entirely present.

"I see the journey. Every step of it. We leave in autumn—three months from now, after the worst heat passes. We join a caravan led by a merchant named Mahmoud. He's taking textiles and spices to Damascus. We pay him to let us travel with his group for protection.

"The journey takes four months. We walk through desert, through mountains, along the coast. It's hard—very hard. Food runs short. Water is scarce. Bandits are a threat, though we avoid them. Khalil nearly dies—" her voice caught slightly, "—but Rania saves him with pomegranate seeds I give her. Magic, or medicine, or both.

"I die in the Syrian desert. Fever, like I've always known. But I die content, knowing the rest of you continue. You reach Beirut in January. You arrive with almost nothing. But Yousef is there—the Benefactor, Grandfather's ghost, come to help. He gives you a shop, gives you capital, gives you the foundation to rebuild.

"And you do rebuild. Nabil becomes a businessman. Sahar becomes the family's next seer. Khalil becomes a poet. You survive WWI. You thrive. Not easily, not without loss. But you survive, and the family continues, and that's what matters."

She opened her eyes, returning fully to the present. "That's what I see. Clear as memory, because in some way, it's already happened. Time isn't linear. This journey has always been inevitable."

"What if we don't go?" Farid asked. "What if we choose to stay?"

"Then you die here. All of you. Within two years. The carpet shows that too. The staying-path ends in graves. The going-path ends in continuation. That's the choice."

Rania had been silent through all this, but now she spoke. "I see her too."

Everyone turned to her.

"The woman," Rania continued. "The one who weaves. She has green eyes. She appears in our courtyard sometimes, standing next to the carpet. She never speaks, just smiles. I thought I was going mad. But she's real, isn't she? A ghost. An ancestor."

"Shirin," Jalila said softly. "Yes. She watches over us. Many of them do. The dead aren't gone—they're just on the other side of the weaving."

"She wants us to go," Rania said. "I can feel it. She's been preparing me, showing me things. How to read the carpet better. How to see ghosts more clearly. She's been teaching me because I'll need those skills in Beirut." She looked at Farid. "Your father and aunt aren't mad. They're right. We have to go."

Farid felt something shift in his chest. His wife—pragmatic, rational Rania—believed. And if she believed after all her skepticism, maybe that meant something.

"All right," he said. "We go. But we plan carefully. Three months to prepare. We sell everything except what we can carry. We save every fils. We map the route. We make this work."

"We'll make it work," Jamil said firmly. "The carpet says so."

The next three months were a controlled demolition of their life in Baghdad.

They sold everything. The few pieces of furniture they owned went to neighbors. Rania's jewelry—mostly copper, nothing precious—went to a metalworker. Farid sold his tools one by one, keeping only those he'd need to repair carpets in Beirut. They sold clothes, cooking pots, the sleeping mats the children used. Everything.

The community thought they were insane. Friends tried to talk them out of it. The local imam suggested they were running from debt. Neighbors whispered that Farid had committed some crime and was fleeing justice.

But they continued, methodically stripping away everything that connected them to Baghdad except the carpet and their memories.

Nabil, at eleven, understood enough to be frightened. "What if there's nothing in Beirut? What if we get there and can't find work?"

"Then we'll figure it out," Farid told him. "That's what this family does. We transform, we adapt, we survive. You've got Maktabian blood—that means you're stubborn enough to make anything work."

Sahar, at eight, was curious rather than frightened. She asked constant questions: How far is Beirut? What language do they speak? Will there be carpet shops? Can I learn to weave like Great-Great-Great-Grandmother Shirin?

Khalil, at five, was too young to fully understand but sensed the adults' tension and became clingy, refusing to sleep unless Rania held him.

Two weeks before departure, Rania took the children to visit the Tigris one last time. They stood on the bank, watching the famous river flow past the city it had defined for millennia.

"Will we ever come back?" Sahar asked.

"No," Rania said honestly. "This is goodbye. Say it properly. Thank the river for giving us water. Thank the city for giving us shelter. And then let it go."

They stood in silence, each saying their private farewells to the only home they'd known. When they turned to leave, Rania swore she saw Jalila's ghost standing behind them, transparent but present, smiling with approval.

*It's starting*, the ghost seemed to say. *The threshold is opening*.

The morning of departure arrived cold and bright. Autumn, 1901. The date Jalila had predicted decades ago, when she was a young woman receiving visions she barely understood. The date written into the carpet's patterns, woven into their family's fate.

They gathered everything they'd managed to keep: one pack per person, filled with clothes, dried food, waterskins, Khalil's medicine. And the carpet, rolled tight, wrapped in oilcloth, carried on Jamil's back despite his age.

"Too heavy for you," Farid said. "Let me carry it."

"No. It's my burden until we reach Beirut. Then it's yours. That's how it works. Each generation carries it as far as they can, then passes it on."

They left before dawn, wanting to avoid attention and farewells. The streets were empty, the souqs not yet open, only night workers and homeless people awake to see them pass.

At the northern gate—the gate that led toward the desert, toward Syria, toward the coast—they paused. This was it. The moment of no return. Once they passed through, they were refugees, pilgrims, wanderers. No longer residents of Baghdad but something else entirely.

"Last chance to turn back," Farid said, though he didn't mean it.

"No," Jamil said. "There's no turning back. There never was."

Jalila stood with her eyes closed, feeling the moment. "We're at the threshold. Can you feel it? The pattern shifting, the future solidifying. This is when we step from one life into another."

"I'm frightened," Sahar whispered.

"Good," Jalila said, opening her eyes and smiling at her great-niece. "Fear means you understand what we're risking. But don't let it stop you. Sometimes the most important thing you'll ever do is terrifying."

They walked through the gate as the sun rose behind them, lighting their way forward while leaving Baghdad in shadow. Farid looked back once—saw the city where his family had lived for generations, poor and struggling and barely surviving but alive—and then turned his back on it.

Forward. Always forward. That's what the carpet taught. Don't look back at what you've lost. Look ahead at what you might gain.

The desert stretched before them, vast and hostile and promising death to the unprepared. But they were prepared. They had water, food, the protection of the caravan they'd arranged to join. And they had the carpet, rolled on Jamil's back, carrying the family's history and future both.

Behind them, Baghdad woke to another day. One family lighter, though no one noticed. The city had seen countless refugees come and go over millennia. What were seven more?

But the Maktabians knew they mattered. Not to the city, but to themselves. To the thread that connected them to their ancestors and descendants. They were the generation that moved, that broke the stagnation, that carried the family from one world into another.

"I can see it," Jalila said quietly as they walked. "Beirut. White buildings. Blue water. It's real. We'll make it."

"You won't," Jamil said, his voice tight. "You'll die before we arrive."

"I'll make it in spirit. That's what matters."

Rania, walking beside them with Khalil on her hip, said: "She's already here. The ghost. Jalila's ghost, walking ahead of us. I can see her, leading the way."

"I'm not dead yet," Jalila protested.

"But you're already becoming what you'll be. The guide. The one who walks between worlds. You've been preparing your whole life for this."

They walked in silence after that, seven living people and one ghost-to-be, carrying a carpet that held four centuries of history, heading toward a city they'd never seen but somehow knew as home.

The last of Baghdad disappeared behind them.

And ahead, somewhere beyond the desert and the mountains and the threshold, waited Beirut.

Waited transformation.

Waited the next chapter of a story that refused to end.
